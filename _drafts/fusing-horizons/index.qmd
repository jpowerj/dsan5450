Oddly, despite its relevance for this class, the only DSAN class where I have talked about this topic was when I taught **DSAN5200: Advanced Data Visualization**. There, we were thinking through the question of ["how much context do I need to provide for my audience?"](https://jjacobs.me/dsan5200-03/w02/slides.html#/but-how-much-context-do-i-need-to-provide), and Gadamer's notion of "fusing horizons" felt like the appropriate answer to that question.

Here, in DSAN 5450, it's all the more relevant since we're discussing exactly how to **bring context into** our notions of fairness.

So, let's start with this video
