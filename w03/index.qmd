# Recap / Loose Ends {data-stack-name="Week 2 Wrapup"}

## Loose Ends {.smaller .crunch-title}

* Normative vs. Descriptive **"Exploitation"**: How can we disentangle these in our understanding of the term? [@roemer_free_1988]
  * Under descriptive definition, one can "exploit" **corn** or **land** in the exact same way one "exploits" **human labor** (just another type of input into the production process)
  * Utility-wise, an economy **with** exploitation can be **unambiguously better** than one **without** exploitation: if 10 people $H$ own means of production, and 990 people $S$ own only their labor power (landless peasants, for example), allowing $H$ to exploit $S$ for a wage increases utility for both: $H$ acquires profits, $S$ doesn't starve to death
* "Tracing back" causes / **unraveling history**
  * *"The result [of modern 24-hour news cycles] is a litany of events with no beginning and no real end, thrown together only because they occurred at the same time[,] cut off from their **antecedents** and **consequenes**"* [@bourdieu_sociology_2010]

# Metaethics {data-stack-name="Metaethics"}

A scary-sounding word that just means:

> "What we talk about when we talk about ethics",

in contrast to

> "What we talk about when we talk about [insert particular ethical framework here]"

## Reflective Equilibrium {.crunch-title}

* Most criticisms of any framework boil down to, "great in theory, but doesn't work in practice"
* The way to take this seriously: **reflective equilibrium** 
* Introduced by @rawls_outline_1951, but popularized by @rawls_theory_1971

# Descriptive vs. Normative Judgements {.not-title-page .title-11}

| Descriptive (Is) | Normative (Ought) |
| - | - |
| Grass is green (true) | Grass ought to be green (?) |
| Grass is blue (false) | Grass ought to be blue (?) |

## Easy Mode: Descriptive Judgements {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-p}

**How did you acquire the concept "red"?**

* People pointed to stuff with certain properties and said "red" (or "rojo" or "Á∫¢"), as pieces of an **intersubjective** communication system
* These **descriptive** labels enable *coordination*, like driving on left or right side of road!
* Nothing very profound or difficult in **committing** to this descriptive coordination: *"for **ease of communication**, I'll vibrate my vocal chords like this (or write these symbols) to indicate $x$, and vibrate them like this (or write these other symbols) to indicate $y$"*
<!-- * Technically you have the free will to **refuse** this prescription. But, nothing very "" -->
* Linguistic choices, when it comes to **description**, are arbitrary*: Our mouths can make <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet' target='_blank'>these sounds</a>, and each language is a mapping: [combinations of sounds] $\leftrightarrow$ [things]
  * diÀêsÀà√¶n Ààf…™fti f…îr Ààf…™fti [<a href='http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=dis%C3%A6n%CB%88f%C9%AAfdif%C9%94%C9%B9%CB%88f%C9%AAfti' target='_blank'>US Accent <i class='bi bi-box-arrow-up-right'></i></a> / <a href='http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=dis%C3%A6n%CB%88f%C9%AAfdif%C9%94%C9%B9%CB%88f%C9%AAfti&voice=Dora' target='_blank'>Icelandic Accent <i class='bi bi-box-arrow-up-right'></i></a>]

<!-- dis√¶nÀàf…™fdif…î…πÀàf…™fti  / dis√¶nÀàf…™fdif…î…πÀàf…™fti -->
<!-- * Our lives/the world would not be very different if "red" was switched with "green"; i.e., the main change would just be vibrating different vocal chords or writing different symbols to communicate the concept -->

\**(Tiny text footnote: Except for, perhaps, a few <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect' target='_blank'>fun but rare onomatopoetic cases</a>)*

## What Makes Ethical Judgements "More Difficult"? {.smaller .title-11 .crunch-title .crunch-p}

**How did you acquire the concept "good"?**

* People pointed to **actions** with certain properties and said "good" (and pointed at others and said "bad"), as part of instilling **values** in you
* "Grass is green" just links two **descriptive** referents together, while "Honesty is good" takes the **descriptive** concept "honesty" and *links it* with the **normative** concept "good"
* In doing this, parents/teachers/friends are doing way more than just linking sounds and things in the world (**de**scribing): they are also **prescribing** rules of moral conduct!
* **Normative** concepts go beyond "mere" communication: course of your life / future / [things that matter deeply to people] differ if you **act on** one set of norms vs. another
* $\implies$ Ethics centrally involves non-arbitrarily-chosen **commitments**!

## Tl;dr

* **Languages** are **arbitrary conventions** for communication
* **Ethical systems** **build on** this language to **non-arbitrarily** mark out things that are good/bad
* Life would **not** be very different if we "shuffled" words (we'd just vibrate our vocal chords differently), but **would** be very different if we "shuffled" good/bad labeling

## Quick Aside: Top 10 Linguist Beefs {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-figcaption .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-ul .crunch-images}

* Statement on previous slide (*"Life would not be very different if we shuffled words"*), might seem weird/closed-minded/dismissive if you have a certain popular prior belief...

## Contemporary Example: Palestine {.smaller .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote .crunch-li .crunch-p}

* Very few of the relevant **empirical** facts are in dispute, since opening of crucial archives to three so-called "New Historians" in the 1980s. So why do people still argue?

::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#pappe-text}

* **Ilan Pappe**, one of these historians, concluded from this material that:
  * The Israeli state was built upon a massive ethnic cleansing, and
  * Is not morally justifiable [@pappe_ethnic_2006]

> The immunity Israel has received over the last fifty years encourages others, regimes and oppositions alike, to believe that human and civil rights are irrelevant in the Middle East. The dismantling of the mega-prison in Palestine will send a different, and more hopeful, message.

:::
::: {#morris-text}

* **Benny Morris**, another of these historians, concluded that:
  * The Israeli state was built upon a massive ethnic cleansing, and
  * Is morally justifiable [@morris_birth_1987]

> A Jewish state would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 Palestinians. Therefore it was necessary to uproot them. There was no choice but to expel that population. It was necessary to cleanse the hinterland and cleanse the border areas and cleanse the main roads.

<!-- [...] The term "cleanse" doesn't sound nice but that's the term they used at the time. I adopted it from the 1948 documents. -->

# Individual Ethics $\rightarrow$ Social Ethics {data-stack-name="Individual vs. Social Ethics"}

## One Solution: Individual Rights {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-quarto-figure .crunch-figcaption .crunch-images .crunch-math .crunch-ul}

::: {layout="[2,1]" layout-valign="center"}

::: {#rights-text}

* Rights are **vetoes** which **individuals** can use to cancel out **collective**/institutional decisions which affect them (key example for us: right to **privacy**)
* Rawls/liberalism: individual rights are **lexically prior to** "efficiency" and/or distributional concerns
* Why the buzzword "lexically"? Enter (non-scary) math!
* We can put *lowercase* letters of English alphabet in an **order**: $\texttt{a} \prec \texttt{b} \prec \cdots \texttt{z}$
* We can put *capital* letters of English alphabet in an order: $\texttt{A} \prec \texttt{B} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{Z}$
* What if we need to sort stuff with **both** types? We can decide that capital letters are **lexically prior** to lowercase letters, giving us a combined ordering:

:::

![@dworkin_taking_1977](images/dworkin.jpg){fig-align="center" width="300"}

:::

$$
\boxed{\texttt{A} \prec \texttt{B} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{Z} \prec \texttt{a} \prec \texttt{b} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{z}}
$$

## Lexical Ordering (I Tricked You üòà)

::: {layout="[2,1]"}
::: {#trick-left}

* You thought I was just talking about *letters*, but they're actually **variables**: capital letters are rights, lowercase letters are distributive principles

$$
\underbrace{\texttt{A} \prec \texttt{B} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{Z}}_{\mathclap{\substack{\text{Individual Rights} \\ \text{Basic Goods}}}} \phantom{\prec} \prec \phantom{\prec} \underbrace{\texttt{a} \prec \texttt{b} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{z}}_{\mathclap{\substack{\text{Distributive Principles} \\ \text{Money and whatnot}}}}
$$

## Better Metaphor Than Letters {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-math}

* Letters are where Rawls gets "lexically prior" from, but letters are **total orderings** (we know where *every* letter "stands" in relation to *every* other letter)
* Better metaphor: a **high school** with a hierarchy such that

$$
\text{Seniors} \prec \text{Juniors} \prec \text{Sophomores}  \prec \text{Freshmen} 
$$

* $\implies$ If you're a Freshman, whether at the "top" or "bottom" of a ranking of Freshmen, you're still **prior to** all Sophomores...
* Why is this more helpful? Because **we don't need to define** the **rankings *within* classes** to know the **rankings *between* classes** in this case

* Otherwise, if you **both stay silent**, they have very little evidence and can only jail you for **1 year**
* However, there's a catch: if you **both confess**, you both get **two years** in jail, since they now have maximal evidence

  * So it is **better to testify**
* If $B$ **testifies**, what is $A$'s best option?
  * **Staying silent** results in **3 years** of jail
  * **Testifying** results in **2 years** of jail
  * So it is **better to testify**
* The result: **regardless of what $B$ does**, $A$ is **better off testifying**!

## The Convention of Traffic Lights {.smaller .crunch-title}

* Now in **"correlated equilibrium"**, where we ensure* coordinated $\Pr((\textsf{Drive}, \textsf{Stop})) = 0.5$, $\Pr((\textsf{Stop}, \textsf{Drive})) = 0.5$
* $\mathbb{E}[u_A] = (0.5)(0) + (0.5)(-3) = -1.5$

* Empirical (anthropological) findings across literally thousands of different cultures throughout the world: people are willing to **give up rewards** to **ensure fairness** (see, e.g., @henrich_search_2001)

[\**(through, for example, traffic laws: equal in theory... In practice? Another story)*]{.fn-span}

## So How Should We Make/Choose Conventions? {.title-08}

* @hobbes_leviathan_1651: Only way out of "war of all against all" is to surrender all power to one **sovereign** (the *Leviathan*)
* @rousseau_social_1762: Social contract
* *[Big big ~200 year gap here... can you think of why? Hint: French Revolution in 1789]*
* @rawls_theory_1971: Social contract **behind the "veil of ignorance"**
  * If we didn't know **where we were going to end up** in society, how would we set it up?
<!-- * @dworkin_what_1981: Yes, plus also people can **buy insurance** against ending up in a bad place $\rightarrow$ level of "just" redistribution -->

## Rawls' Veil of Ignorance {.crunch-title}

* Probably the most important tool for policy whitepapers!
* "Justice as fairness" (next week: fairness in AI üòú)
* We don't know whether we'll be $A$ or $B$ in the intersection game, so we'd choose the **traffic light**!
* More profoundly: We don't know what **race**, **gender**, **class**, **ethnicity**, **sexuality**, **disability status** we'll have; We don't know whether we'll be **Israeli** or **Palestinian**; we don't know whether we'll own **means of production** or own only our **labor power** (and thus have to sell it on a market to survive)... ü§î

# Nuts and Bolts for Fairness {data-stack-name="Fairness"}

## One Final Reminder {.crunch-title}

* Industry rule #4080: Cannot "prove" $q(x) = \text{``Algorithm }x\text{ is fair''}$! Only $p(x) \implies q(y)$:

$$
\underbrace{p(x)}_{\substack{\text{Accept ethical} \\ \text{framework }x}} \implies \underbrace{q(y)}_{\substack{\text{Algorithms should} \\ \text{satisfy condition }y}}
$$

* Before: **possible ethical frameworks** (values for $x$)
* Now: **possible fairness criteria** (values for $y$)

## Categories of Fairness Criteria {.smaller .crunch-title}

```{=html}
<style>
#fairness-box .columns {
  display: flex !important;
  height: 100% !important;
}

#fairness-box .column {
  /* border: 2px solid black !important; */
  padding: 14px !important;
  box-sizing: border-box !important;
  /* height: 100% !important; */
}
</style>
```

Roughly, approaches to fairness/bias in AI can be categorized as follows:

<div id="fairness-box" style="border: 2px solid black !important; box-sizing: border-box !important;">

<center>
**Fairness**
</center>

<!-- start columns -->
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="46%"}

<div style="border: 2px solid black !important; height: 100% !important;">

**Context-Free**

* Single-Threshold Fairness
* Equal Prediction
* Equal Decision

* Fairness via Similarity Metric(s)
* Causal Definitions

</div>

<!-- end quarto box -->

* [Today] **Context-Free** Fairness: Easier to grasp from CS/data science perspective; rooted in "language" of Machine Learning (you already know much of it, given DSAN 5000!)
* But **easy-to-grasp notion** $\neq$ **"good" notion**!
* Your job: push yourself to (a) consider what is getting **left out of** the context-free definitions, and (b) the **loopholes** that are thus introduced into them, whereby people/computers can discriminate while remaining "technically fair"

## Laws: Often Perfectly "Technically Fair" {.title-09}

> *Ah, la majestueuse √©galit√© des lois, qui interdit au riche comme au pauvre de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain!*

## We Can Do (A Bit) Better... {.smaller}

* Use **random variables** to model inferences made by an algorithm (or a human!)
* $\implies$ fairness by statistically **equalizing** loan rejections, error rate, etc. between groups
* Obvious **societal** drawback: **equality** does not ameliorate the effects of **past injustices** (see: police contact vs. trust-in-government plot from last week)
  * This one we saw coming, given "context-free" nature!
* Less obvious **mathematical** drawback: **impossibility results** (because algebra üò≥)
  * Roughly: can't satisfy [more than] two statistical fairness criteria at once; similar to how setting $\Pr(X) = p$ also determines $\Pr(\text{not }X) = 1 - p$, or how plugging $x = 3$ into $x + y = 5$ leaves only one possibility $y = 2$
* **BUT**, "impossibility" $\neq$ impossibility: (a) one criteria may be "all you need" in given setting; (b) can derive **more robust** measures by "relaxing" confusion-matrix measures

## What the Fairness Measures Will Feel Like For Now {.smaller .crunch-title .title-10}

![](images/rock_on_rich_brian.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

* (They will get more robust and will **incorporate context** soon, I promise!)

## Who Remembers... üéâ*Confusion Matrices!!!*üéâ {.smaller .crunch-title .title-11}

* Terrifyingly higher stakes than in DSAN 5000, however!
* Now $D = 1$ could literally mean *"shoot this person"* or *"throw this person in jail for life"*

![From @mitchell_algorithmic_2021](images/mitchell_et_al.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Our First Fairness Measure (Finally)! {.crunch-title .smaller .crunch-ul .crunch-math}

* Standard across the literature: Random Variable $A_i$ "encoding" membership in protected/sensitive group. In HW1, for example:

$$
A_i = \begin{cases}
0 &\text{if }i\text{ self-reported ``white''} \\
1 &\text{if }i\text{ self-reported ``black''}
\end{cases}
$$

* **Notice**: choice of mapping into $\{0, 1\}$ here **non-arbitrary**!
* We want our models/criteria to be **descriptively** but also **normatively robust**; e.g.:
* **If** (antecedent I hold, though <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/08/12/deep-divisions-in-americans-views-of-nations-racial-history-and-how-to-address-it/' target='_blank'>majority in US</a> do not) one believes that ending (much less repairing) centuries of unrelenting white supremacist violence here might require asymmetric race-based policies,
* **Then** our model should allow different **normative labels** and differential **weights** on

  $$
  \begin{align*}
  \Delta &= (\text{Fairness} \mid A = 1) - (\text{Fairness} \mid A = 0) \\
  \nabla &= (\text{Fairness} \mid A = 0) - (\text{Fairness} \mid A = 1)
  \end{align*}
  $$

  despite the **descriptive** fact that $\Delta = -\nabla$.

## Where Descriptive and Normative Become Intertwined {.crunch-title .title-07}

* Allowing this **asymmetry** is precisely what enables bring **descriptive** facts to bear on **normative** concerns!
* **Mathematically** we can always "flip" the mapping from racial labels into $\{0, 1\}$...
* But this (in a precise, mathematical sense: namely, *isomorphism*) implies that we're treating **racial categorization** as the same type of phenomenon as **driving on left or right side of road** (see: prev slides on why we make the descriptive vs. normative distinction)
* (See also: Sweden's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_H' target='_blank'>Dagen H</a>!)

## "Fairness" Through Equalized *Positive* Rates {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .title-08}

$$
\Pr(D = 1 \mid A = 0) = \Pr(D = 1 \mid A = 1)
$$

* This works specifically for discrete, **binary**-valued categories
* For general attributes (whether discrete or continuous!), generalizes to:

$$
D \perp A \iff \Pr(D = d, A = a) = \Pr(D = d)\Pr(A = a)
$$

## "Fairness" Through Equalized *Error* Rates {.smaller .crunch-title .title-12}

* Equalized **False Positive Rate**:

$$
\Pr(D = 1 \mid Y = 0, A = 0) = \Pr(D = 1 \mid Y = 0, A = 1)
$$

* Equalized **False Negative Rate**:

$$
\Pr(D = 0 \mid Y = 1, A = 0) = \Pr(D = 0 \mid Y = 1, A = 1)
$$

* For general (non-binary) attributes: $(D \perp A) \mid Y$:

$$
\Pr(D = d, A = a \mid Y = y) = \Pr(D = d \mid Y = y)\Pr(A = a \mid Y = y)
$$

## NO MORE EQUATIONS! üò§ {.smaller}

* Depending on your background and/or learning style (say, visual vs. auditory), you may be able to look at equations on previous slides and "see" what they're "saying"
* If your brain works similarly to **mine**, however, your eyes glazed over, you began dissociating, planning an escape route, etc.
* If you're in the latter group, welcome to the **cult of Probabilistic Graphical Models** üòà

## Baby Steps: A Real-World Confusion Matrix {.title-11 .crunch-title .smaller}

| | Labeled Low-Risk | Labeled High-Risk |
| - | - | - |
| **Didn't Do More Crimes** | *True Negative* | *False Positive* |
**Did More Crimes** | *False Negative* | *True Positive* |

: {tbl-colwidths="[30,40,40]"}

* What kinds of **causal connections** and/or **feedback loops** might there be between our **decision variable** (low vs. high risk) and our **outcome variable** (did vs. didn't do more crimes)
* What types of **policy implications** might this process have, after it "runs" for several "iterations"?
* Why might some segments of society, with some shared ethical framework(s), **weigh** the **"costs"** of false negatives and false positives **differently** from other segments of society with different shared ethical framework(s)?
* (Non-rhetorical questions!)

<!-- ## Minimizing Loss Function Penalizing (Only) These Errors $\iff$ Single-Threshold Fairness {.smaller .crunch-title .title-09}

* Loss function: $\ell(d, \widehat{d})$
* An **optimal classifier** minimizes the expected loss: $\mathbb{E}[\ell(\widehat{d},d)]$
* A **decision** is considered to be fair if individuals with the same score $s_i = \psi(v_i)$ are treated equally, regardless of group membership (Corbett-Davies & Goel 2018). -->
