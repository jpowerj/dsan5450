A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination.” American Economic Review. (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004)\n\n\nWe study race in the labor market by sending fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perceived race, resumes are randomly assigned African-American- or White-sounding names. White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. Callbacks are also more responsive to resume quality for White names than for African-American ones. The racial gap is uniform across occupation, industry, and employer size. We also find little evidence that employers are inferring social class from the names. Differential treatment by race still appears to still be prominent in the U.S. labor market.\n\n\nSo… Is [Solved-ness of problem] = [Closeness of racial gap to 0%]?\nEven on solely empirical, ahistorical basis (meaning, even without reparations for past harms in antecedents), there are reasons why 0% gap may not be the goal…\nTo see why, we have to dig into race as a verb rather than a noun"

To manipulate perceived race, resumes are randomly assigned African-American- or White-sounding names. White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. Callbacks are also more responsive to resume quality for White names than for African-American ones. The racial gap is uniform across occupation, industry, and employer size. We also find little evidence that employers are inferring social class from the names. Differential treatment by race still appears to still be prominent in the U.S. labor market.\n\n\nSo… Is [Solved-ness of problem] = [Closeness of racial gap to 0%]?\nEven on solely empirical, ahistorical basis (meaning, even without reparations for past harms in antecedents), there are reasons why 0% gap may not be the goal…\nTo see why, we have to dig into race as a verb rather than a noun",

Students will explore and critically evaluate a range of data-related issues in contemporary society, such as responsible data collection, algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, democratic participation in data usage and data-driven decisions, and the ethical implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (self-driving cars, ChatGPT, crowd-sourced training data, etc.).\nBeginning with a set of historical case studies—instances in which scientists, engineers, and policymakers have been forced to re-evaluate their ethical intuitions in light of technological developments (nuclear power, use of social media platforms to organize protests and influence political outcomes, deployment of facial recognition software and predictive AI by police and military forces)—the course then introduces a set of general ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics), challenging students to consider their relative strengths and weaknesses for addressing modern technological-ethical dilemmas faced by businesses, healthcare organizations, governments, and academic institutions. After a final portion of the course linking these ethical frameworks with practical regulatory and policy considerations, students will write and present a policy whitepaper analyzing a data-ethical issue of particular interest to them, integrating ethical perspectives, regulatory principles, and domain knowledge into a recommendation of best practices for the relevant agency, firm, or institution.\nThe course will thus equip students with a robust ethical “toolbox” for conscientiously gathering, interpreting, and extracting meaning from data throughout their careers as data scientists, while respecting privacy, fairness, transparency, democratic accountability, and other social concerns.

    "section": "Course Overview",
    "text": "Course Overview\nThe course revolves around three “pillars”, which we’ll examine individually before bringing them together for your final projects at the end of the class: high-level ethical issues in data science, general ethical frameworks, and public policy applications.\n\nData Science\nA portion of the course will focus on introductions to cutting-edge technologies like self-driving cars, ChatGPT, facial detection algorithms, and various applications of AI to police and military technologies. For this portion, we’ll draw fairly often from the contents of the following books:\n\nPerez (2019): Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men.\nCatherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein (2020). Data Feminism. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. [Free, open-source!]\nCathy O’Neil (2016). Weapons of Math Destruction. New York, NY: Crown Books.\n\nSince there are plenty of in-depth resources available to you (e.g., other Georgetown courses!) for learning the technical details of these technologies, our goal in this course will be to learn just the particular aspects of each technology which are most relevant to the ethical and policy issues they present.\nFor example, we will look at Neural Netwok-based Machine Learning algorithms, but we will focus specifically on how the performance of these algorithms on a given task depends crucially on the existence of effective training data for that task. The breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence which have had an immense impact on society over the past few decades, for example, have not come about because of new algorithms (neural networks, for example, have been around since the 1950s). Rather, they have come about because of the massive, exponential increase in the amount of data available to train these already-existing algorithms: for example, data scraped from across the entire web, or from millions of scanned books, or from Wikipedia’s massive collection of articles. This means, therefore, that these algorithms simply encode pre-existing human biases into algorithmically-derived “rules”, thus motivating the next pillar of the course: Ethics!\n\n\nEthics\nFor the ethics-focused portion of the course, we’ll be reading selections from the following textbook:\n\nLewis Vaughn and Louis P. Pojman (2021). The Moral Life: An Introductory Reader in Ethics and Literature. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. [PDF]\n\nFrom the vast array of readings contained in this collection, we’ll look at both “standard” ethical readings from e.g. Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant plus readings from literary sources like Ursula Le Guin and Ambrose Bierce.\n\n\nPublic Policy\nFor the final piece of the course we will take the technological developments discussed the first portion, analyze them using the ethical frameworks discussed in the second portion, and come to conclusions as to what types of things lawmakers, governments, and civil society organizations (NGOs, for example, and Think Tanks) can do in practice to address the ethical issues raised by these technologies. This means that, specifically, the recommended final project for the course will be a Policy Whitepaper, where you will choose a particular institution and make a recommendation to them in terms of how they can use their power (for example, the power to pass laws) to most effectively address an ethical issue that you believe is important.\nFor this portion of the class we’ll have to draw on a wide range of different readings, depending on what particular subdomains of public policy are most interesting to you all, but as a general textbook on ethics in data science which does focus a good amount on policy specifically, we will look at:\n\nAnne L. Washington (2023). Ethical Data Science: Prediction in the Public Interest. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.\n\nNow that you have an overview of the trajectory of the course, the following section contains the particulars of what we’ll be reading and working on each week!",

Specifically, late penalties will be applied based on the following scale (unless you obtain an excused lateness from one of the instructional staff!):\n\n0 to 24 hours after due date: no penalty\n24 to 30 hours after due date: 2.5% penalty\n30 to 42 hours after due date: 5% penalty\n42 to 54 hours after due date: 10% penalty\n54 to 66 hours after due date: 20% penalty\nMore than 66 hours after due date: Assignment submissions no longer accepted (without instructor approval)\n\nExcused lateness exceptions will be grounded in a policy where you can “pause” the class (due-date-wise, but also just, expectation-of-progress-wise more generally) to take the time you need to handle things happening in your life.

Many scholars have done just that, defending either ProPublica’s or Northpointe’s definitions against what they see as the misguided alternative. (Simons 2023)\n\nAnother option: study and then work to ameliorate the social conditions which force us into this realm of mathematical impossibility (why do the poor have no food?)\n\nThe impossibility result is about much more than math. [It occurs because] the underlying outcome is distributed unevenly in society. This is a fact about society, not mathematics, and requires engaging with a complex, checkered history of systemic racism in the US. Predicting an outcome whose distribution is shaped by this history requires tradeoffs because the inequalities and injustices are encoded in data—in this case, because America has criminalized Blackness for as long as America has existed."

    "text": "So… What Do We Do? Part 2: Incorporate Context\n\nOne option: argue about which of the two definitions is “better” for the next 100 years (what is the best way to give food to the poor?)\n\nIt appears to reveal an unfortunate but inexorable fact about our world: we must choose between two intuitively appealing ways to understand fairness in ML. Many scholars have done just that, defending either ProPublica’s or Northpointe’s definitions against what they see as the misguided alternative. (Simons 2023)\n\nAnother option: study and then work to ameliorate the social conditions which force us into this realm of mathematical impossibility (why do the poor have no food?)\n\nThe impossibility result is about much more than math. [It occurs because] the underlying outcome is distributed unevenly in society. This is a fact about society, not mathematics, and requires engaging with a complex, checkered history of systemic racism in the US. Predicting an outcome whose distribution is shaped by this history requires tradeoffs because the inequalities and injustices are encoded in data—in this case, because America has criminalized Blackness for as long as America has existed.",

The question is, who has it?\nFurther thought led us to the idea that this is what ownership is.

Students will explore and critically evaluate a range of data-related issues in contemporary society, such as responsible data collection, algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, democratic participation in data usage and data-driven decisions, and the ethical implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (self-driving cars, ChatGPT, crowd-sourced training data, etc.).\nBeginning with a set of historical case studies—instances in which scientists, engineers, and policymakers have been forced to re-evaluate their ethical intuitions in light of technological developments (nuclear power, use of social media platforms to organize protests and influence political outcomes, deployment of facial recognition software and predictive AI by police and military forces)—the course then introduces a set of general ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics), challenging students to consider their relative strengths and weaknesses for addressing modern technological-ethical dilemmas faced by businesses, healthcare organizations, governments, and academic institutions. After a final portion of the course linking these ethical frameworks with practical regulatory and policy considerations, students will write and present a policy whitepaper analyzing a data-ethical issue of particular interest to them, integrating ethical perspectives, regulatory principles, and domain knowledge into a recommendation of best practices for the relevant agency, firm, or institution.\nThe course will thus equip students with a robust ethical “toolbox” for conscientiously gathering, interpreting, and extracting meaning from data throughout their careers as data scientists, while respecting privacy, fairness, transparency, democratic accountability, and other social concerns.

    "text": "A Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) is just a formal mathematical representation of a data-generating process. So, if we wanted to model the relationship between weather and a person’s choice of whether to go out and party or stay in and watch a movie on a given Saturday evening, we could begin by proposing the following data-generating process:\nNow, given the description of a PGM given above (nodes as variables, edges as relationships between variables), we can perform the move alluded to in the previous section: we can convert our data-generating process into a PGM, by defining nodes (variables) and edges (relationships) as follows:\nThe resulting PGM, in graphical form1, is presented below, followed by the Conditional Probability Table describing the edge from the \\(W\\) node to the \\(Y\\) node.\nPGMs can help us make inferences about the world in the face of incomplete information, which is the situation in nearly every real-world problem. The key tool here is the separation of nodes into two categories: observed (represented graphically as a shaded node) and latent (represented graphically as an unshaded node).\nThus we can now use our model as a weather-inference machine: if we observe that the person we’re modeling is out at a party with us, what can we infer from this information about the weather outside? We can draw this situation as a PGM with shaded and unshaded nodes, as in the figure below, and then use Bayes’ Rule to perform calculations over the network, to see how the observed information about the person at the party “flows” back into the node representing the weather.\nKeeping in mind that Bayes’ Rule tells us, for any two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), how to use information about \\(\\Pr(B \\mid A)\\) to obtain information about \\(\\Pr(A \\mid B)\\):\n\\[\n\\Pr(A \\mid B) = \\frac{\\Pr(B \\mid A)\\Pr(A)}{\\Pr(B)},\n\\]\nWe can now apply this rule to obtain our new probability distribution over the weather, taking into account the new information that the person has chosen to go out:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\Pr(W = \\textsf{Sunny} \\mid Y = \\textsf{Go Out})\n= \\frac{\\Pr(Y = \\textsf{Go Out} \\mid W = \\textsf{Sunny})}{\\Pr(Y = \\textsf{Go Out})} \\\\\n= &\\frac{\\Pr(Y = \\textsf{Go Out} \\mid W = \\textsf{Sunny})}{\\Pr(Y = \\textsf{Go Out} \\mid W = \\textsf{Sunny}) + \\Pr(Y = \\textsf{Go Out} \\mid W = \\textsf{Rainy})}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAnd now we simply plug in the information we already have from our conditional probability table to obtain our new (conditional) probability of interest:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(W = \\textsf{Sunny} \\mid Y = \\textsf{Go Out}) &= \\frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{(0.8)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.5)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.4}{0.45} \\approx 0.89.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWe have learned something interesting: now that we’ve observed the person out at a party, the probability that it is sunny out jumps from \\(0.5\\) (called the “prior” estimate of \\(W\\), i.e., our best guess without any other relevant information) to \\(0.89\\) (called the “posterior” estimate of \\(W\\), i.e., our best guess after incorporating relevant information)."

For this step, what clicks in my brain is to use the definition of how we translate the logical “or” into a statement involving probabilistic events (here we use the independence of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in the last step):\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(Z = 1) &= \\Pr(X = 1 \\vee Y = 1) \\\\\n&= \\Pr(X = 1) + \\Pr(Y = 1) - \\Pr(X = 1 \\wedge Y = 1) \\\\\n&= 1/3 + 1/3 - (1/3)(1/3) = 2/3 - 1/9 = \\frac{5}{9}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAs a reminder here, in looking for the joint pdf, we’re looking for the missing values in the following table.

Since the first three calculated probabilities sum to \\(4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 = 8/9\\), we can conclude that the final slot is \\(\\Pr(X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1) = \\frac{1}{9}\\)!\nOr, if we want to compute it directly for sanity:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1) &= \\Pr(Z = 1 \\mid X = 1, Y = 1)\\Pr(X = 1, Y = 1) \\\\\n&= 1 \\cdot \\Pr(X = 1, Y = 1) = \\Pr(X = 1)\\Pr(Y = 1) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThus our final pdf table is:\n\n\n\n\\(X\\)\n\\(Y\\)\n\\(Z\\)\n\\(\\Pr(X, Y, Z)\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\\(4/9\\)\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n\\(2/9\\)\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n\\(2/9\\)\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n\\(1/9\\)"

Recalling that \\(\\Pr(Y = 1 \\mid Z = 1) = \\frac{3}{5}\\), let’s now compute the change in this quantity when \\(X = 1\\) is observed.

To see this, let \\(\\Pr_{Z = 1}(E)\\) denote the probability of an event \\(E\\) that we would infer if we only had data with \\(Z = 1\\). Using this notation, we get that\n\\[\n\\Pr_{Z = 1}(Y = 1) = \\frac{3}{5},\n\\Pr_{Z = 1}(Y = 1 \\mid X = 1) = \\frac{1}{3},\n\\]\nin other words, we may easily be “tricked” into concluding that observing \\(X = 1\\) decreases the probability of \\(Y = 1\\), despite the fact that we know these diseases occur independently, given our knowledge of the full underlying DGP."

Spent too long, meaning, we didn’t get to cover the case of the do-Calculus modified DGP, where we force \\(E \\leftarrow 1\\) within the DGP itself, so that we could see how this ability to intervene in the DGP is what allows us to infer causation from correlation!\nSo, in this writeup, I’d like to write it out, so that rather than me trying to sprint through it on the board in the classroom, you can process it at your own pace 💆"

So, let’s do that here! The following code literally just implements the DGP as closely as possible, where we make it clear that each row is one individual person by also generating a name each time the DGP is run:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse) |&gt; suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(Rlab) |&gt; suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nlibrary(randomNames) |&gt; suppressPackageStartupMessages()\nset.seed(5450)\nrun_dgp &lt;- function(p1, p2, p3) {\n    u1 &lt;- rbern(n=1, prob=p1)\n    u2 &lt;- rbern(n=1, prob=p2)\n    u3 &lt;- rbern(n=1, prob=p3)\n    v_val &lt;- u1\n    e_val &lt;- ifelse(v_val == 1, 0, u2)\n    y_val &lt;- ifelse(v_val == 1, 0, u3)\n    rand_name &lt;- randomNames(1, which.names=\"first\")\n    return(tibble_row(name=rand_name, v=v_val, e=e_val, y=y_val))\n}\n# Generate one person's data using DGP\nrun_dgp(p1=1/2, p2=1/3, p3=1/3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nv\ne\ny\n\n\n\n\nAlexander\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what this means is, we could generate a population using this DGP, and then use our tools from 5100 to analyze its properties. Here we generate a population of \\(N = 5000\\) people:\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(5450)\nN &lt;- 10000\nprivate_school_df &lt;- tibble(name=character(), v=numeric(), e=numeric(), y=numeric())\n# Run DGP N times, to generate size-N population\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n    cur_draw &lt;- run_dgp(1/2, 1/3, 1/3)\n    private_school_df &lt;- bind_rows(private_school_df, cur_draw)\n}\nprivate_school_df |&gt; head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nv\ne\ny\n\n\n\n\nAlexander\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nGabriel\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nSaabiqa\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nSafar\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nHafsa\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nChris\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe (seemingly minor but nonetheless important) point of doing all that stuff on the board rather than R, in this case, was to show how even if we have an infinite population we still get this problem—in other words, it’s not a problem that can be solved by just taking more and more samples.\nBut, we can start to see the problem even with our finite R-generated population. So, please keep in mind how the above code is what you don’t see—what you do see is, you show up to work one day with the above-generated dataset saved as private_school_data.csv, ready for you to analyze (but, again, you don’t get to see the code that generated it!)\nTo make the point in an even more emphatic, over-the-top way, here we save the dataset as private_school_data.csv, then in the next section you’ll put your data scientist hat on and reload it:\n\n\nCode\nprivate_school_df |&gt; write_csv(\"private_school_data.csv\")"

    "text": "Change in Probability After Conditioning on \\(E = 1\\) \\(\\neq\\) Causal Effect of \\(E = 1\\)!\nSo, on the chalkboard, we worked (painfully) through a DAG that looked like the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere we asked: given the above unobserved DGP which gives rise to the joint distribution of \\((V, E, Y)\\), can we assess whether or not that arrow \\(E \\rightarrow Y\\) should be there? Or in other words, can we assess whether \\(E\\) has a causal effect on \\(Y\\)?\nUsing only the tools of probability theory, the best approach we have for trying to answer this is to compute the following two quantities:\n\n\\(s_{\\text{overall}} \\definedas \\Pr(Y = 1)\\)\n\\(s_{\\text{private}} \\definedas \\Pr(Y = 1 \\mid E = 1)\\)\n\nAnd then, our intuition is that if \\(s_{\\text{private}} &gt; s_{\\text{overall}}\\), then receiving a private school education increases our chances of success—due to the slipperyness of language when it comes to association vs. causation, it is easy to then interpret this as saying, “Private school education causes an increase in likelihood of success”. But, that’s exactly why statistics professors hit students on the head with the “correlation does not imply causation” stick! Is because, we can’t say that!\nUsually, therefore, in those types of classes even in the best case you usually just compute these two quantities, see how \\(s_{\\text{private}}\\) is in fact greater than \\(s_{\\text{public}}\\) despite the lack of “true” causation, and leave it at that. So, let’s start with that step now, using our simulated population we loaded earlier.\nWe already found, by computing mean(private_school_df$y), that \\(\\Pr(Y = 1) \\approx \\frac{1}{6}\\). So, now let’s also use what we know from 5100 to compute the conditional probability we want, \\(\\Pr(Y = 1 \\mid E = 1)\\), by subsetting our sample to include only people for whom \\(E = 1\\), and then re-computing \\(\\Pr(Y = 1)\\) within this subset. First, the subset itself (giving us a df with only those individuals in the simulated population who went to private school):\n\n\nCode\nprivate_only_df &lt;- private_school_df[private_school_df$e == 1,]\nprint(nrow(private_only_df))\n\n\n[1] 1603\n\n\nCode\nprivate_only_df |&gt; tail()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nv\ne\ny\n\n\n\n\nRazeena\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nJordan\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nDeirdre\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nGaelen\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nMonaye\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nWajdi\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, within this subgroup, we recompute \\(\\Pr(Y = 1)\\) to obtain our conditional probability:\n\n\nCode\nmean(private_only_df$y)\n\n\n[1] 0.338116\n\n\nThus giving us a value which is approximately equal to the population-level value we computed out on the board: that the conditional probability of success given private school education here is\n\\[\n\\Pr(Y = 1 \\mid E = 1) = \\frac{\\Pr(Y = 1, E = 1)}{\\Pr(E = 1)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{18}}{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nTherefore, what we’ve found is that:\n\nAcross everyone in the population, the likelihood of success is \\(s_{\\text{overall}} = \\frac{1}{6}\\), but\nAmong individuals who went to private school, the likelihood of success is \\(s_{\\text{private}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\nSo, private schools can justifiably claim, in this (hypothetical) case, that attending their school doubles one’s likelihood of success! The question that remains is, should we interpret this “doubling” as essentially denoting…\n\nA verb attached to “attending private school” (a thing that “attending private school” does is “doubles success chance”); or\nA property of the emergent distribution, i.e., the less strong claim that \\(Y = 1\\) occurs within the population with \\(E = 1\\) at twice the rate that \\(Y = 1\\) occurs within the overall population"

The “point” of science (again, under antecedents argued for in that book) is to hypothesize and then evaluate causal claims! So, let’s see how the \\(\\textsf{do}\\) operator helps us here.

In the counterfactual world where everything is the same as before but now we intervene to assign the value \\(1\\) to \\(E\\) (and let the DGP operate as it did before, other than that change), the probability of success remains the same as the probability of success in the overall population:\n\n\\(\\Pr(Y = 1) = \\frac{1}{6}\\)\n\\(\\Pr(Y = 1 \\mid \\textsf{do}(E = 1)) = \\frac{1}{6}\\),\n\nwhich tells us that (within our custom-cooked world!) getting a private school education does not cause an increase in the likelihood of success.\n…So yeah, that is where we would have ended up if I had planned out my timing for the Chalkboard Lab a little better, so, I just hope that reading through this can better highlight the usefulness of the \\(\\textsf{do}\\) operator for distinguishing which associations are “just associations” and which actually correspond to causal relationships!"

Let \\(\\overline{\\mathcal{W}}\\) and \\(\\overline{\\mathcal{B}}\\) represent the white and black populations of the US respectively (recall from e.g. DSAN5100 the use of Greek letters, or at least curly capitalized Latin letters, to represent population parameters! And, as for why they have \\(\\overline{\\text{overlines}}\\) above them, read onwards).\nLet’s first attempt (and fail) to define a Random Variable \\(\\widetilde{A}\\) (short for “Protected Attribute” in this case) representing the race self-reported to the US Census for a randomly-chosen person from the population of the US (\\(\\overline{\\Pi}\\)), such that\n\\[\n\\widetilde{A} = \\begin{cases}\n0 &\\text{if Self-Reported White} \\\\\n1 &\\text{if Self-Reported Black}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhy is there a tilde (~) above the \\(A\\) there (and why does this fail to serve as a valid Random Variable as defined in probability theory)? Because, before we can even get off the ground, we have to have the background knowledge that individuals responding to the Census’ questions can list more than one race: there are many individuals in the US for whom the event \\(\\widetilde{A} = 0\\) and \\(\\widetilde{A} = 1\\) both occur if they happen to be the randomly-chosen person. Thus, since Random Variables are by definition:\n\nFunctions which map\nOutcomes from a sample space (which are by definition mutually-exclusive, since the set of possible outcomes forms a partition of the sample space \\(\\Omega\\)) to\nValues in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\),\n\n\\(\\widetilde{A}\\) is straightforwardly not a valid Random Variable—the conditions of the Kolmogorov axioms, which enable expressions in probability theory to be “true” in the same way that the ZFC axioms enable \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) to be “true”, do not permit non-mutually-exclusive outcomes.\nSo, if we simply ignore this fact and “jump” directly to white vs. black in the way that this is usually done—a jump that, admittedly, we made ourselves in Question 4 of HW1—this should trigger a “red flag” in your mind, with respect to the question from the Operationalization slides about, “is this variable really measuring what it says it is measuring?”\nTo address this issue, at minimum, we’ll need to define two Random Variables \\(B\\) and \\(W\\), such that\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nB &= \\begin{cases}\n0 &\\text{if Did Not Self-Report Black} \\\\\n1 &\\text{if Self-Reported Black}\n\\end{cases} \\\\\nW &= \\begin{cases}\n0 &\\text{if Did Not Self-Report White} \\\\\n1 &\\text{if Self-Reported White}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSo that now \\(B = 1\\) and \\(W = 1\\) can both be true for an individual, which does not violate any Kolmogorov axioms!\nThen, we can read more into the methodology that the Hamilton Project/Brookings study cited above uses, to find that they\n\n\nSplit individuals in the dataset into several racial groups on the basis of one-reported-race only responses, and then\n\n\nOnly computed rates of drug use for the one-reported-race respondents who reported either black or white.\n\n\nSo, solely for the (descriptive) purpose of matching their provided data on drug usage with base rate information from the Census (see below), we’ll now define a non-tilde version of \\(A\\) which is what the two bars in the above plots really represent. Letting\n\\[\nS = \\begin{cases}\n0 &\\text{if Multiple Self-Reported Races} \\\\\n1 &\\text{if Single Self-Reported Race}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwe can now handle the first bullet point by defining a new sub-population \\(\\Sigma \\subset \\overline{\\Pi}\\) consisting of all Census respondents who self-reported only one race, i.e., all Census respondents in \\(\\overline{\\Pi}\\) for whom \\(S = 1\\).\nBut, to handle the second bullet point, we need to define a second sub-population \\(\\Pi \\subset \\Sigma \\subset \\overline{\\Pi}\\), of those individuals in \\(\\Sigma\\) for whom \\(W = 1\\) or \\(B = 1\\).\nIt is with respect to this second sub-population \\(\\Pi\\) that we can now finally define a valid binary Random Variable \\(A\\) as\n\\[\nA = \\begin{cases}\n0 &\\text{if }W = 1 \\\\\n1 &\\text{if }B = 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere we need to keep in mind that \\(A\\) is only well-defined with respect to \\(\\Pi \\subset \\Sigma \\subset \\overline{\\Pi}\\).\nNow, as the Hamilton Institute/Brookings study (and many many, probably most, studies of race in the US) defines it implicitly, we can therefore be more explicit here that we are:\n\nMapping \\(A = 0\\) to the term “White” and\nMapping \\(A = 1\\) to the term “Black”.\n\nCorrespondingly, we can map:\n\nThe set of individuals in \\(\\Sigma\\) for whom \\(A = 0\\) to the term “white population” and the symbol \\(\\mathcal{W}\\) (mirroring the \\(\\overline{\\mathcal{W}}\\) from earlier) and\nThe set of individuals in \\(\\Sigma\\) for whom \\(A = 1\\) to the term “black population” and the symbol \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) (mirroring the \\(\\overline{\\mathcal{B}}\\) from earlier)\n\nI will drop the scare-quotes on “Black” and “White” in a lot of places going forward, so your job is to insert them in your mind when you read the two non-scare-quoted words! I understand if that strikes you as pedantic at first, but please keep in mind the goal of transparency and reproducibility in science (those aren’t even from this class, they’re from the core DSAN5000 class, week 1!): the point is to enable people who are (rightfully) skeptical about data scientists studying race to at least be able to scroll up here and uncover some of the layers of assumptions undergirding our operationalization of “race” here.\n\n\n(1.3) Axioms and Antecedents: Drug Usage\nNow, to characterize the height of the bar plotted in the figure’s left panel (as opposed to the split of the population into two separate bars), we need to define \\(D\\) as a Random Variable (short for “Drugs” in this case) representing the drug use of a randomly-chosen person from \\(\\Pi\\), such that\n\\[\nD = \\begin{cases}\n0 &\\text{if Doesn't Use Drugs} \\\\\n1 &\\text{if Uses Drugs}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAnd now we can represent the two bar heights, the two population-level parameters, as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[D \\mid A = 0] = \\Pr(D = 1 \\mid A = 0) &\\approx 0.18 \\\\\n\\mathbb{E}[D \\mid A = 1] = \\Pr(D = 1 \\mid A = 1) &\\approx 0.16\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWhere the expectation and probability measures are equal in this case because the Random Variable \\(D\\) is binary (0/1)[1].\nNotice how, there are implementation factors coming into play in moving from this information towards the Fairness in AI material below, since we have a somewhat weird case of something (drug use) that we can infer at the population level despite not being able to easily observe it at the individual level. In other words, to move to the next “step” from this one, we’re already pushing a lot of stuff-from-weeks-1-and-2 (for example, the ethics of elicitation of sensitive data—an individual is not going to be as forthcoming in their illegal drug usage as they would be their eye color).\n\n\nThis is a straightforward probability-using-binary-RVs theorem, not something specific to 5450, but I think it can help to re-state it early on here: that if \\(X\\) is a binary 0/1 Random Variable, then the definition of expectation of a RV gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[X] \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\sum_{v_X \\in \\mathcal{R}_X}v_X \\cdot \\Pr(X = v_X) = 0 \\cdot \\Pr(X = 0) + 1 \\cdot \\Pr(X = 1) = \\Pr(X = 1)\n\\]\n\n\n(1.4) Population Base Rates\nAlthough the population-level data above is technically available for use by researchers, on its own it doesn’t help very much for researchers working with ML-based classifiers for example, since it basically represents a dataset with \\(N = 2\\) observations:\n\nimport pandas as pd\npop_df = pd.DataFrame({'quote_unquote_race': [0, 1], 'prop_uses_drugs': [0.16, 0.18]})\npop_df\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nquote_unquote_race\nprop_uses_drugs\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0.16\n\n\n1\n1\n0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\nTo even get started in terms of being able to use this data to evaluate fairness, we need to also know the base rates of the two subgroups \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{W}\\) with respect to their combined population \\(\\Sigma\\). For example, Chapter 3 of Barocas et al. (2024) builds its description of fairness in AI around classification as the problem of determining (predicting) values of \\(y\\) for given values of \\(x\\), rooted in jointly distributed Random Variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), with a particular collected dataset viewed as samples from\n\na probability distribution over pairs of values \\((x,y)\\) that the random variables \\((X,Y)\\) might take on.\n\nIn our case, notice how we currently only have the two conditional expectations written above, not a full joint distribution of \\(D\\) and \\(A\\). So, we should be able to identify the missing piece by writing out the joint distribution as a function of conditional and marginal distributions (in prob/stats textbooks, this is usually introduced as the definition of conditional probability):\n\\[\n\\Pr(D \\mid A) = \\frac{\\Pr(D, A)}{\\Pr(A)} \\implies \\Pr(D, A) = \\underbrace{\\Pr(D \\mid A)}_{\\text{We have this}}\\underbrace{\\Pr(A)}_{\\text{We don't have this}}\n\\]\nSo, we have to go out and find the missing term \\(\\Pr(A)\\). Thankfully for this case, the US Census Bureau’s job is to take censuses of the self-reported race of the US population. Less thankfully, these are reported with respect to \\(\\overline{\\Pi}\\), not \\(\\Pi\\), so we’ll need to re-normalize.\nYou can find the Census population percentages here, which tell us that:\n\nThe “White alone” percentage \\(\\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(W = 1, S = 1)\\) is 0.753,\nThe “Black alone” percentage \\(\\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(B = 1, S = 1)\\) is 0.137, and\nThe percentage reporting two or more races \\(\\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(S = 0)\\) is 0.031\n\nFirst, since the Census provides \\(\\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(S = 0)\\), but the Hamilton/Brookings study’s population is those for whom \\(S = 1\\), we’ll need to use the Kolmogorov axioms to derive\n\\[\n\\textstyle\n\\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(S = 1) = 1 - \\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(S = 0) = 0.969.\n\\]\nFrom this quantity we can derive\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\textstyle \\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(W = 1 \\mid S = 1) &= \\frac{\\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(W = 1, S = 1)}{\\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(S = 1)} = \\frac{0.753}{0.969} \\approx 0.777 \\\\\n\\textstyle \\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(B = 1 \\mid S = 1) &= \\frac{\\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(B = 1, S = 1)}{\\Pr_{\\overline{\\Pi}}(S = 1)} = \\frac{0.137}{0.969} \\approx 0.141 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\ntherefore giving us (by the way we defined \\(\\Sigma\\) above):\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\textstyle \\Pr_{\\Sigma}(W = 1) &= 0.777 \\\\\n\\textstyle \\Pr_{\\Sigma}(B = 1) &= 0.141\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nand finally, by the way we defined \\(\\Pi\\) (where, since this is our target population, the one we’d like to use for the remainder of the demo, we define \\(\\Pr_{\\Pi}(E) \\equiv \\Pr(E)\\)),\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(A = 0) &= \\frac{\\Pr_{\\Sigma}(W = 1)}{\\Pr_{\\Sigma}(W = 1 \\vee B = 1)} = \\frac{0.777}{0.777 + 0.141} \\approx 0.846 \\\\\n\\Pr(A = 1) &= \\frac{\\Pr_{\\Sigma}(B = 1)}{\\Pr_{\\Sigma}(W = 1 \\vee B = 1)} = \\frac{0.141}{0.777 + 0.141} \\approx 0.154\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\n(1.5) Working with the Joint Distribution\nNow that we have the missing piece allowing us to fully characterize the joint distribution, we can (finally) start deriving a few of the non-immediately-obvious implications from the data we have. For example:\nThe probability of being a drug user\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(D = 1) &= \\Pr(D = 1, A = 0) + \\Pr(D = 1, A = 1) \\\\\n&= \\Pr(D = 1 \\mid A = 0)\\Pr(A = 0) + \\Pr(D = 1 \\mid A = 1)\\Pr(A = 1) \\\\\n&= (0.18)(0.846) + (0.16)(0.154) \\approx 0.177\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe probability of being a non-drug user (a sanity check to make sure our probabilities satisfy Kolmogorov axioms)\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(D = 0) &= \\Pr(D = 0, A = 0) + \\Pr(D = 0, A = 1) \\\\\n&= \\Pr(D = 0 \\mid A = 0)\\Pr(A = 0) + \\Pr(D = 0 \\mid A = 1)\\Pr(A = 1) \\\\\n&= (0.82)(0.846) + (0.84)(0.154) \\approx 0.823\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe probability that someone is black given that they are a drug user\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(A = 1 \\mid D = 1) &\\overset{\\text{Bayes}}{\\underset{\\text{Thm}}{=}} \\frac{\\Pr(D = 1 \\mid A = 1)\\Pr(A = 1)}{\\Pr(D = 1)} = \\frac{(0.16)(0.154)}{0.177} \\\\\n&\\approx 0.139\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe probability that someone is white given that they are a drug user\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(A = 0 \\mid D = 1) &\\overset{\\text{Bayes}}{\\underset{\\text{Thm}}{=}} \\frac{\\Pr(D = 1 \\mid A = 0)\\Pr(A = 0)}{\\Pr(D = 1)} = \\frac{(0.18)(0.846)}{0.177} \\\\\n&\\approx 0.860\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAnd, more generally, we can write out the entire joint distribution in a table like\n\n\n\n\n\\(D = 0\\)\n\\(D = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(A = 0\\)\n\\(\\Pr(A = 0, D = 0)\\)\n\\(\\Pr(A = 0, D = 1)\\)\n\n\n\\(A = 1\\)\n\\(\\Pr(A = 1, D = 0)\\)\n\\(\\Pr(A = 1, D = 1)\\)\n\n\n\nWhich we compute using Python here to save time (though in general the types of calculations above are fair game for assignments / exams!)\n\nimport numpy as np\npA0 = 0.846\npA1 = 1 - pA0 # Hooray for mantissas (...mantissae? mantissi?)\npD1_given_A0 = 0.18\npD0_given_A0 = 1 - pD1_given_A0\npD1_given_A1 = 0.16\npD0_given_A1 = 1 - pD1_given_A1\n\n# Joint probabilities\npD1_A0 = pD1_given_A0 * pA0\nprint(pD1_A0)\npD1_A1 = pD1_given_A1 * pA1\nprint(pD1_A1)\npD0_A0 = pD0_given_A0 * pA0\nprint(pD0_A0)\npD0_A1 = pD0_given_A1 * pA1\nprint(pD0_A1)\n\njoint_dist = np.array([\n    [pD0_A0, pD1_A0],\n    [pD0_A1, pD1_A1]\n])\nprint(joint_dist)\n\nprint(np.sum(joint_dist))\nprint(pD0_A0 + pD0_A1 + pD1_A0 + pD1_A1) # Coolio\n\n0.15228\n0.024640000000000006\n0.69372\n0.12936000000000003\n[[0.69372 0.15228]\n [0.12936 0.02464]]\n1.0\n1.0"

    "text": "(2) Making Predictions Related to This Data\nNow, moving from 5100-esque to 5450-specific topics, let’s think about a decision-making system which utilizes surveillance cameras installed around a given neighborhood. This system aims to identify people’s faces using these cameras and then, on the basis of a given person \\(i\\)’s facial image features \\(X_i\\), classify them into one of two classes:\n\\[\n\\widehat{D}_i = \\begin{cases}\n0 &\\text{if }i\\textbf{ Not}\\text{ a Predicted Drug User} \\\\\n1 &\\text{if }i\\textbf{ Is}\\text{ a Predicted Drug User}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nIt turns out that, given the descriptive (and context-free) definitions of fairness at the core of the Fairness in AI literature, we have almost everything that we need, besides a loss function.\nUsing a slightly different notation than the one we use in e.g. DSAN 5300 (we can convert between the two notations if need be!), in a fairness context the loss is often parameterized with respect to a given true label value \\(y\\) and a given prediction for that label \\(\\widehat{y}\\): \\(L(\\widehat{y}, y)\\) tells us the “badness” of predicting a value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) when the true value that we were trying to predict is \\(y\\).\nOne standard loss function, used by pretty much any binary classifier (say, those in scikit-learn) unless the default settings are modified, is the misclassification loss:\n\\[\nL(0, 0) = 0, L(0, 1) = 1, L(1, 0) = 1, L(1, 1) = 0\n\\]\nThis loss function assigns a “badness” of 1 when the prediction was incorrect, and a “badness” of 0 when the prediction was correct, so that it can be condensed even more using the indicator function \\(\\mathbb{1}\\) into just:\n\\[\nL(\\widehat{y}, y) = \\mathbb{1}[\\widehat{y} \\neq y].\n\\]\nWe can also represent this loss function in a form that resembles a confusion matrix (which we’ll use a lot from now on!), keeping in mind that it’s just the same form as a confusion matrix, not a confusion matrix itself:\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\widehat{D}_i = 0\\)\n\\(\\widehat{D}_i = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(D = 0\\)\n0\n1\n\n\n\\(D = 1\\)\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n(2.1) Fairness Definition 1: Statistical Parity\nStatistical Independence is satisfied if\n\\[\n\\Pr(\\widehat{D} = 1 \\mid A = 0) = \\Pr(\\widehat{D} = 1 \\mid A = 1)\n\\]\nSo, let’s see how/whether this fairness definition “matches up with” our intuitions around fairness!\nFirst, let’s construct a “population” of size \\(\\nu = 1000\\) (since our estimates only go to 3 decimal places max), using the joint distribution derived above, that we can sample from (though, for our purposes here, our “sample” will in fact be the entire population, so that \\(N = \\nu = 1000\\)):\n\n\n(2.2) Constructing a Simulated Population\n\nimport pandas as pd\nnu =

    "text": "1. Things I Googled / Opened During Class\n\n(a) Eugenia Cheng talk at Google, “The Art of Logic” (YouTube)\nIt’s the part from 14 minutes onwards where she starts drawing the diagrams relevant to us: “tracing back” an ethically-charged scenario from observed consequents (e.g., person gets beaten up and taken off the plane) to the massive collection of hypothesized antecedents (e.g., flight delays, policies of overbooking, capitalism, efficiency of the airline, and the incentives thereof). To map it back into something from the slides for this class: this “tracing back” corresponds (in my view) to the term I mentioned in the slides from last week: “unraveling history”.\nHopefully the Eugenia Cheng talk, in combination with this notion of “unraveling history” or “tracing consequents to antecedents”, can help you in seeing how difficult it is to answer the question of when to stop doing this “tracing back” and start intervening. If I was to keep ranting, I would mention how my “solution” here, to the extent that “solutions” are possible, is (i) humans aren’t fully rational, but we can incorporate the limits of our own rationality into our models of humans in some sense, e.g. as is done in models of boundedly rational; then, with a bounded-rationality-based model in hand, (ii) Bayes rule literally gives us a mathematically “optimal” rule, given an objective function of “choosing the best course of action given all information available to us at a given moment”, for which course of action to choose. This essay by Simon DeDeo from Carnegie Mellon University does a better job than I ever could at explaining and justifying why this might be a good model for decision-making under uncertainty (and why it makes sense to call it “Bayesian Reasoning”), despite its horribly pretentious/condescending title :P\n\n\n(b) Walter Thabit, How East New York Became A Ghetto (2003): PDF\nThis one is a bit more peripheral to the main topics in this class, but yeah I wanted to bring it up in class and then also send the PDF here because: if data science in urban policy is your jam, it’s a perfect example of how the data we have nowadays about differential health outcomes and correlates of crime and etc. for different neighborhoods in NYC didn’t magically “appear” in nice .csv format – it exists because of some combination of political organizing and agitation and etc. (which Walter Thabit himself very much took part in), in conjunction with the discrepancies that were pointed out in a more “qualitative” way by works in urban sociology like this one and its precursors…"

    "section": "2. “Exploitation” as Descriptive vs. Normative Term in Economics",
    "text": "2. “Exploitation” as Descriptive vs. Normative Term in Economics\nI basically completely stammered my way through answering this question in-class, which I’m mad at myself for since imo “exploitation” is a 100% perfect example for looking at how words can have entirely different meanings, and how people can make diametrically opposed judgements of their validity, both within and between the “descriptive” and “normative” realms.\nIn this case, analysis/discussion in the descriptive realm could look like: should we attach the label [“exploitation” (as descriptive term)] to [equation \\(A\\)] or [equation \\(B\\)]? Then, in the normative realm, analysis/discussion could look like: is [“exploitation” (as descriptive term, labeling equation \\(X \\in \\{A, B\\}\\))] morally objectionable? Is it something an institution could feasibly reduce, in theory? And if so, should they use the scarce resources available to them to try and reduce it?\nThe reason I stammered and felt so embarrassed that I couldn’t give a good succinct answer is because… I have no idea how to explain it without sounding like I’m doing a cringey flex/humblebrag type of thing but here goes:\nPrinceton University Press literally commissioned me to write a book chapter answering exactly that question back in 2018 lol, as basically part of a little companion book to a new edition of Das Kapital coming out in September this year (as part of my role on the editorial board for that), woohoo! But then, 10% because of covid and 90% because of my inability to finish anything, the chapter still isn’t finished and isn’t coming out anytime soon. Worse, it’s not even helpful to link the pdf draft in its current state (since there are literally like, half-finished equations in it, section headers without text, etc.). But if the question of different ethical perspectives on economically-defined exploitation is interesting to you, I am happy to send you a sloppy-but-finished pdf of the next draft in ~a week or two!\nSo yeah, embarrassed because I couldn’t just say “read my book!” given its current disheveled state, SO the resolution to all this is that I’m just going to link PDFs for two finished and published book! One by a person I mentioned in week 1, John Roemer:\n\n(a) Roemer, Free to Lose: An Introduction to Marxist Economic Philosophy (1988) [PDF], Chs. 2 and 4\nThis book gives an “intuitive” model of exploitation in plain English in Chapter 2, then a mathematical model with a semi-formal microeconomic definition of exploitation in Chapter 4.1\n\n\n(b) Morishima, Marx’s Economics (1973) [PDF], Ch. 5: “Surplus Value and Exploitation”\nIf you were an econ major, and especially if you feel good about econometrics stuff that uses linear algebra and matrix equations, you might instead prefer [chapter 5 of this book] by Michio Morishima, which (a) is better in the sense that it uses more standard econ terms, but then (b) is worse in the sense that it is all building to the argument it became famous for (in chapter 14), that Marxian exploitation can be defined without assuming the so-called Labor Theory of Value. Which was interesting in the 70s when it came out, but by 1988 Roemer could mostly just get to the point of defining and discussing exploitation without having to call it Exploitation-but-not-the-kind-thats-defined-using-Labor-Theory-of-Value.\nMoving back on-topic to DSAN 5450, though, the Morishima book does have a nice feature in that Chapter 2 is called “Hidden Assumptions”! Where he goes more into what antecedents might be hiding behind the term “exploitation” when it is used by neoclassical economists vs. Marxian economists."

    "text": "3. HW1: Nuts and Bolts for Fairness in AI\nI’ve already written way too much and included way too many PDFs here, but I’d rather have you overly rather than under-ly prepared for HW1, so I just wanted to give a quick preview of what will be on it, with pointers towards stuff where, if you skim them for example, you’ll know what to do when the homework comes along.\nTo be clear: most of the contents of these readings will be scary and confusing, since (a) we haven’t discussed them yet, but also (b) they’re entire papers/books devoted solely to a single topic that is just one among several topics in this class. And so the idea is just: you can look at these, maybe read the ones that you find sufficiently interesting and ignore the ones you don’t, and then your brain will be “primed” for the full-on understanding we’ll develop through slides + homework!\n\n(a) Recovering “Race” from Proxy Variables\nThere are a million bazillion books and articles and essays from humanities and the social sciences which I am forcing myself not to list here, because I want to just give yall a short-and-sweet primer you can use to understand the issue with “Step 1: remove the variable called ‘race’ -&gt; Step 2: problem solved 🥳💯” from a straightforward, data-science-rooted standpoint. So, for that, I’d go with this one:\n\nMichael Carl Tschantz, “What is Proxy Discrimination?” (2022)\n\n\n\n(b) Discrimination in Advertising\n\nAli et al. (2019). “Discrimination through optimization: How Facebook’s ad delivery can lead to skewed outcomes”, arXiv Preprint\n\nThis topic purposefully comes after (a) though (a) and (b) form a connected pair, since the results in this paper will seem very confusing/suspicious without knowledge about more and less valid ways of “recovering” race despite absence of a variable called “race” in the dataset. In the study, they employ an absolutely brilliant method (imo) for discovering discrimination in Facebook’s ads, but then they do a bit of a “sleight of hand” in just saying “we’ve found that the discrimination is based on race”, when in fact it’s “we’ve found that the discrimination is based on [estimated race inferred from proxy variables in a way that you might think is valid but you also might think is invalid]”.\n\n\n(c) Confusion matrix fairness\nAs you might see on the slides we haven’t gotten to yet, the two main resources I’m drawing on for this part are:\n\nChapter 3 of Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan’s Fairness in Machine Learning (2023) (the full book is online for free, legally!), titled “Classification”\nMitchell et al. “Algorithmic Fairness: Choices, Assumptions, and Definitions”. Annual Review of Statistics and its Applications (2021)\n\nBut then, really, an approach to the confusion matrix-based definitions (among others!) that probably fits even better with the class is this presentation from Narayanan (the third author on the above Fairness in ML book), which is refreshing in that it explicitly links fairness definitions with political considerations, rather than trying to “hide” them behind… math/science/greek letters\n\nArvind Narayanan, “Tutorial: 21 Fairness Definitions and Their Politics”, from FAT-ML Conference, 2018 (YouTube)\n\n\n\n(d) Causal-path fairness\n\nChapter 5 of the Fairness in Machine Learning book mentioned above is all about causality-based approaches.\n\nIt’s not my favorite starting point tbh, but since I already linked that book, if you find that you like its approach, you can read Ch 6 as well…\nTo me, a central work in this sphere is:\n\nLily Hu, “What is ‘Race’ in Algorithmic Discrimination on the Basis of Race?”, Journal of Moral Philosophy (2024, forthcoming)\n\nThis is the distillation of Lily’s “thick constructivist” theory of race that I mentioned today. But the intuition behind it is broken down into maybe more digestible chunks with pictures and stuff in her blog posts on the Phenomenal World blog. There are 5 things listed there, but the last 2 are interviews so just skip those, I’m referring to “Disparate Causes Pt. I”, “Disparate Causes Pt. II”, and “Direct Effects”\nThe thing I’m scared of with this part, though, is that Lily’s work is a critique of causal-path fairness definitions, meaning that it can be hard to start there if you don’t know the thing she’s critiquing in the first place… the issue is that the literature on causal pathways is really brutally tough to “break into”, honestly. But, probably the book with the fewest barriers to entry—basically, a book that you have all the necessary background for, as DSAN students—is:\n\nMorgan and Winship (2014). Counterfactuals and Causal Inference [PDF]\n\nAnd then I’ll just say that: a book with the full-on details of everything you’d ever want to know about causal pathways is:\n\nJudea Pearl (2000). Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference [PDF, EPUB]\n\n\n\n(e) Reverse fairness\nThis one was rough tbh, in terms of trying to intro it in Week 2 without the details you’ll have by Week ~7 to 9 when we’ll get into this. Because, it’s actually completely rooted in a topic that maybe sounds… either miserably boring or miserably presumptuous at first: “Optimal Tax Rate Theory” (Optimal labor income taxation / Optimal capital income taxation)\nBut, if you are willing to see what they mean when they say that a tax rate is quote-unquote “optimal”, it will get you most of the way to understanding inverse fairness. As you’re hopefully getting used to, descriptively it means something like:\n\n“[set of criteria \\(C\\) and objective function \\(f\\)] =&gt; [tax rate \\(z^*\\) = maximum of \\(f\\) subject to constraints \\(C\\)]”,\n\nand then normatively it means something like:\n\n“[if \\((C,f)\\) characterize your policy goal(s)] \\(\\implies\\) [you ought to set tax rate to be \\(z\\)]”.\n\nThat’s not as fun or conclusive/satisfying as they way some economists present it (“this is the best most GOATed tax rate and if you don’t choose this tax rate you’re dumb and don’t understand economics!!”), but it allows us to understand the word “optimal” as the \\(q\\) in \\(p \\implies q\\) and move on 😜\nBecause then, we can use Bayes’ rule to go back and forth: from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\), or (!) from \\(q\\) backwards to \\(p\\). And in this case that means: given a set of distributional concerns (\\(p\\)), we can derive an optimal tax rate (\\(q\\)), OR (!) given an existing tax rate \\(q\\), we can infer the distributional concerns \\(p\\) that such a tax rate is implicitly implementing, in the sense of which groups in society are “weighted” higher and lower in the aggregation of individual preferences that manifests in the form of the tax policy.\nSince this is so much later in the class, and the HW1 problem will just be tiiny baby steps in that direction, I’m not too worried about specific articles or anything here – instead, I think actually a really helpful thing to read (though it may seem totally out of nowhere) is:\n\nJean-Paul Sartre (1946) Existentialism is a Humanism [PDF, EPUB], pgs. 30-34\n\nIf you use the EPUB: it’s the series of paragraphs starting with “To give you an example that will help you to better understand what we mean by abandonment”; it’s a section where he talks about a student coming to him for help with “ethically deciding” whether to join the anti-Nazi resistance or stay home and care for his sick mother.\nThe reason I cite that here is because it highlights how, once we’ve set up all these fancy definitions of fairness and causality and social welfare and etc., there is still always going to be an indeterminacy in ethical decision-making: Sartre’s point in giving this anecdote, in my reading of it at least, was to drive home the fact that he could teach this student 20 years of seminars on ethics, and the student could know 500 ethical frameworks in minute detail, and he would still have to do the hard, agonizing emotional work of making the decision. I think that can be a pretty good lesson to help us “zoom out” a bit, if we find ourselves lost in the sauce of “algorithms are gonna make all our decisions and fix everything!!”\nK I’m done,\nJeff"

    "text": "The HW1 Question\nThe question I’m most concerned about was as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHW1 Q3.2: Rights and Distributive Justice\n\n\n\nA group of people is behind the veil of ignorance, debating what rights should be enshrined in a constitution:\n\nThey have decided to enshrine a right to private property in their constitution, implying that all individuals in the society have a duty to avoid trespassing on an individual’s property without their permission. However…\nThey also want to enshrine the right to urgent medical care, implying that the society has a duty to provide life-saving resuscitation if an individual has a heart attack, for example.\n\nThe debate centers around what ought to happen, if both rights are indeed written into the constitution, in the following scenario:\n\nA person \\(i\\) is walking down the (public) sidewalk and suddenly has a heart attack, falling over into person \\(j\\)’s (private) front yard. Paramedics arrive quickly on the scene, but \\(j\\) isn’t home to grant or deny permission for the paramedics to enter their front yard to provide medical care to \\(i\\).\n\nThus the society is deliberating about a third constitutional provision to cover this case, which means choosing an ethical preference ordering over the following two possible worlds:\n\n\\(W_1\\): \\(j\\)’s right to private property is given higher priority, so that the paramedics must not violate this right to provide the medical care to \\(i\\)\n\\(W_2\\): \\(i\\)’s right to urgent medical care is given higher priority, so that the paramedics must violate \\(j\\)’s right to private property and enter the yard to provide the medical care\n\nUnder a Rawlsian ethical framework, is this a prioritization that the society could determine a priori (behind the “veil of ignorance”)? Or is Rawls’ ethical framework indeterminate with regard to this ethical decision? If it is not indeterminate, which of the two possible worlds does the Rawlsian system imply should be preferred by a normatively “good” society?\n\n\\(W_1\\) should be preferred\n\\(W_2\\) should be preferred\nIndeterminate\n\n\n\nThe correct answer here (in an important way!) was (c) Indeterminate. However, a good number of folks put (b) \\(W_2\\) should be preferred. I spent a while trying to dig into this outlier, and I think even the most basic explanation—that many of yall are extremely busy and just chose the one that sounded intuitively best—gives us a nice and super-relevant “learning moment”!\nThe reason I hyper-fixate on this one commonly-missed question here is because, starting with this slide from Week 1, a key thread running throughout the entire course is the importance of looking at/figuring out antecedents, as the only way to “cross the boundary” between your own beliefs and those of others."

    "section": "Why Can’t We Just Use Our Intuition?",
    "text": "Why Can’t We Just Use Our Intuition?\nAnswering this question is… somewhat difficult in terms of how “meta” it is, so, I genuinely apologize (like I did for the Kant writeup) since I don’t know any way to explain it without using some philosophical jargony things 😭\nThe meta-ness comes from the fact that, if a person \\(i\\) says “I believe \\(p\\) because \\(p\\) is obviously true”, and if that predicate \\(p\\) itself is “I can use my intuitions to derive (moral) truths”, then… essentially an infinite-loop of self-reinforcing certainty is created. At best, an interlocutor \\(j\\) can only “chip away at” \\(i\\)’s’ belief-loop, perhaps by e.g. pointing out cases to \\(i\\) where their intuition has failed.2\nBut, with enough “chipping”, \\(i\\) may be convinced to shift their belief towards something more like a predicate \\(q\\), “I can use my intuitions, along with my understanding of other people’s antecedents, to derive moral truths”, which may then reverberate back to “I believe \\(q\\) because \\(q\\) ‘fits with’ the synthesis I’ve formed between my own intuition and the intuitions of others”3\nNonetheless, my implicit antecedent in writing this is that this shift is possible… To inject myself into it one last time, for example, one reason why I included that “My Biases” slide in W01 is because childhood Jeff absolutely would say things like “I believe \\(p\\) because \\(p\\) is obviously true”, where \\(p\\) would be things like “Israel has a right to ‘defend itself’”.4\nSo, with all that said, the reason why I emphasize “antecedent-tracing” so much (and why (c) being the correct answer is important) is precisely because we need somewhere to “go”, data-ethics-and-policy-wise, when the types of conflicts outlined in that question arise in our lives as data scientists!\nOn the one hand, the scenarios in “new employee ethics training” slides, that I called silly in class (bc they are), usually look something like:\n\nBillyBob (Boss): Hey, Alice, you should falsify some data so we can get published and make millions of dollars!!! I will give you a big ‘Employee of the Month’ trophy if you do!!!\nAlice (You): Select a proper response in this scenario\n\nAnd then you’re supposed to click something like “Report BillyBob to [institutional ethics board]”, producing the green check and unlocking the “certified ethics master” achievement.\nOn the other hand, the data-science-career scenarios that I’ve tried to center in class—which can be more pernicious because they are absent from new-employee ethics seminars and thus don’t necessarily have obvious answers—look more like:\n\nBillyBob (Boss): Hey, Alice, we need to include “““crime”“” as a variable in our model, can you go collect data for that?\nAlice (You): Decide (a) how to operationalize “““crime”““, or (b) push back on BillyBob’s command on grounds that perhaps we might not want to reify”““crime”“” in statistical models given ethical issues with how it is measured in available datasets in our current society\n\nAnd in these kinds of cases, whether you choose (a), (b), or some other option, the data-ethical choice you make (the purpose of this class, hence the name) will be rooted in some notion of why it’s a “good” choice to make under those circumstances. And the answer to that why question is precisely the antecedent:\n\nIf you choose (a), for example, perhaps the option is…\n\n“Good” implicitly in terms of reducing your own cognitive dissonance (antecedent = reduction of cognitive dissonance should play a role in ethical decisionmaking), or\n“Good” explicitly because your boss asks you why you chose some particular operationalization and you are able to respond with your reasoning (antecedent = justifiability and/or satisfying your boss should play a role in ethical decisionmaking)\n\nIf you choose (b), for example, your boss may ask you to elaborate/explain why you’re not carrying out the command, which would bring in the same justifiability/boss-satisfaction antecedent as in the previous bullet point.\n\nThen, under the antecedent that the resolution of conflicts like this in a given workplace is a function of the involved agents’ relative power5, your ability to frame your answer to the “why” question in terms of antecedents that will “click” with those of your boss will be directly proportional to your “success” in making the “right” decision here!"

    "text": "How Does the Specifying-Antecedents Approach “Resolve” This Issue?\nThe increase in likelihood of “success” isn’t exactly the end of the story here, though. A more holistic way to summarize the answer to the previous section’s question (the question in the title) is:\nAlthough the approach of “we should operationalize crime as \\(\\underline{\\hspace{60px}}\\) because my intuition says that’s best” or “because it’s obvious” is pretty much exactly how we carry out our day-to-day data-scientific work subconsciously (e.g., during long R/Python sessions!), the goal of the (Geertz 1973) slide from W01 was to point out how:\n\nBeing conscious of our antecedents will be helpful descriptively when we’re working with others who may ask for justification or may not be convinced by “because it’s obvious”, and\nBeing conscious of our antecedents will be helpful normatively in terms of helping us evaluate the alignment between our day-to-day subconscious choices and our conscious ethical values\n\nSo, to finally get to the takeaway in terms of Q3.2: it’s important to know that Rawls’ framework, on its own, does not serve as an antecedent for deciding between different rights that a society has decided to establish!\nRawls’ contribution to ethics, in the broadly-construed way we’ve talked about ethics in the first half of the course, was primarily to give a “middle-ground solution” to the Problem of Utilitarianism that we discussed (torturing one person to make everyone else happy):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRawls as Solution to Utilitarian Torture-One-Person Problem\n\n\n\nSociety adopts Utilitarianism, except for a set of Kant-style (deontological) rules regarding the rights of individuals, which thus serve as “vetos” that individuals can use to override Utilitarian decisions.\n\n\nRawls, however (importantly!) does not provide a framework for (a) which specific rules should be adopted as rights, or (b) the prioritization of certain rights \\(x\\) as “more important than” other rights \\(y\\).\nThis “hedging” by Rawls is, ultimately, not specific to Rawls but just one example of the “Paradox of Liberalism”: if we want a full-on, concrete ethical framework—one which actually specifies the content of what a person/group/organization should do in a particular case… then we need to add on our own antecedents. For example, an antecedent that would make (a) \\(W_1\\) should be preferred correct would be:\n\nRawls’ theory + “The right to private property is more important than the right to medical care”\n\nWhereas an antecedent that would make (b) \\(W_2\\) should be preferred correct would be:\n\nRawls’ theory + “The right to medical care is more important than the right to private property”\n\nAnd thus, one of those two additional antecedents would need to be added, as a third clause to the constitution being debated, for the question to not be indeterminate!\nThat’s… the best I can do in terms of explaining why Q3.2 is so important, and why we shouldn’t answer it based on our intuitions, but should think about the antecedents that would lead to each of the three answer choices! For anyone still reading, who wants the full-on deeper philosophical/cultural reasons that I can’t really do justice to (the more general “crossing the boundary between your own and others’ beliefs” from the W01 slide), check out:\n\nGeertz (1973), The Interpretation of Cultures (the book pictured in that W01 slide),\nSkorupski (1978), “The Meaning of Another Culture’s Beliefs” [Pages 83-106 in this PDF], and\nSkinner (2012), “Interpretation, Rationality, and Truth” [Pages 27-56 in this PDF]"

But, there is (imo) also really exciting research being done in cognitive science/neuroscience labs to test the kinds of theories talked about in those philosophy papers:\nBasically, they use behavioral experiments and EEG/EKG/MRI data to probe into what exactly is going on in people’s heads when they make [logical or ethical] decisions? Those studies usually cite Sperber (1996) as a key “spark” that gave rise to this research program, and it is definitely a mind-blowingly cool book and fun place to start.

Level of aggregation?\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing India’s death rate of 12 per thousand with China’s of 7 per thousand, and applying that difference to the Indian population of 781 million in 1986, we get an estimate of excess normal mortality in India of 3.9 million per year. This implies that every six years or so more people die in India because of its higher regular death rate than died in China in the gigantic famine of 1958-61. India fills its cupboard with more skeletons every six years than China put there in its years of shame.

The more similar the belligerents, the better our estimate of inequality’s effects, as all other traits are shared and thus cannot explain observed differences in performance, helping assess how battlefield performance would have improved (declined) if the belligerent had a lower (higher) level of prewar inequality.\nSince [non-matched] cases are dropped […] selected cases are more representative of average belligerents/wars than outliers with few or no matches, [providing] surer ground for testing generalizability of the book’s claims than focusing solely on canonical but unrepresentative usual suspects (Germany, the United States, Israel)",

The higher an army’s inequality, the greater its rates of desertion, side-switching, and casualties”\n\n\nMatching constructs pairs of belligerents that are similar across a wide range of traits thought to dictate battlefield performance but that vary in levels of prewar inequality. The more similar the belligerents, the better our estimate of inequality’s effects, as all other traits are shared and thus cannot explain observed differences in performance, helping assess how battlefield performance would have improved (declined) if the belligerent had a lower (higher) level of prewar inequality.\nSince [non-matched] cases are dropped […] selected cases are more representative of average belligerents/wars than outliers with few or no matches, [providing] surer ground for testing generalizability of the book’s claims than focusing solely on canonical but unrepresentative usual suspects (Germany, the United States, Israel)"

    "text": "A Harder Case\n\n“Getting Away With” Choosing Ranch Dressing vs. “Getting Away With” Speeding\nThe Kantian approach comes more into play when we think about, e.g., “getting away with” some action. This was Kant’s original motivation for proposing an alternative to utilitarianism: he believed Utilitarianism could never compel individual people to act ethically, since they would say, “Ok but, if I’m better off… why do I care if the rest of society is worse off?”\nThe next step in Kant’s thought process (as in, how he ended up at this conclusion) is way tough to follow, but boils down in Jeff’s trying-to-simplify-everything-despite-rushing-to-finish-this-writeup brain to something like:\n\n Morality is intertwined with freedom, in the sense that if we want to be truly moral we have to arrive at our decisions through our own thought processes, driven by internally-generated motivations, rather than on the basis of some externally-given criterion/source of motivation like that of Utilitarianism5. So then [rushing through 40ish years of him changing, updating, augmenting this theory],\n Freely-made decisions grounded in internally-generated motivations must be arrived at via some law(s) that are not “inputted” into our minds from the external world (otherwise, we could just hit people with the Utilitarianism stick for years and years until they internalized Utilitarianism, which is what Britain tried through e.g. their education system in the 19th century, and yet people raised in this system still acted “immorally” in the Utilitarian sense all the time!), but are instead “immanent”—i.e., derived from within the mind itself without reference to external circumstances (height, weight, ability, class, race, gender, etc.)6\n After even more years of thinking about this, Kant’s final set of works argued that the sole coherent / consistent-in-and-of-itself law that could possibly satisfy this ultra-stringent set of conditions is the Categorical Imperative described above, which is usually translated into English as:\n\n“Act only according to that maxim7 by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.” Kant (1785)\n\n\nFor any clarity beyond this painfully-badly-oversimplified 3-step summary, I refer yall to Korsgaard (1996b), or the series of lectures which aimed to summarize that more-intense book, Korsgaard (1996a), a PDF of which is linked to from the Resources page!\n\n\nThe Case of Speeding\nSo, now let’s re-run the Brain Zapper, but with speeding because we’re late to an appointment (the HW1 example) as our test case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilitarian CPU\nKantian CPU\n\n\n\n\n Simulate two worlds:\n Simulate two worlds:\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{W}_{a}\\): The world from moment of action onwards if Doug chooses to speed\n\\(\\mathcal{W}_{a}\\): The world from moment of action onwards if everyone in the world adoped rule: [if late to appointment, speed]\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{W}_{\\neg a}\\): The world from moment of action onwards if Doug chooses not to speed\n\\(\\mathcal{W}_{\\neg a}\\): The world from moment of action onwards if everyone in the world adoped rule: [if late to appointment, don’t speed]\n\n\n Decide which is better on the basis of some criteria. Since we chose utilitarianism, decide based on utility summed over society:\\(\\displaystyle \\max\\left\\{ \\mathbb{E}[u_i(\\mathcal{W}_{a})], \\mathbb{E}[u_i(\\mathcal{W}_{\\neg a})] \\right\\}\\)\n Speeding is admissible under categorical imperative if \\(\\mathcal{W}_{a}\\) is a world you would feel ok living in.Not-speeding is admissible under categorical imperative if \\(\\mathcal{W}_{\\neg a}\\) is a world you would feel ok living in.\n\n\n\nIn this case, we are likely to have a pretty significant disagreement between the two approaches:\n\nFor the Utilitarian approach, let’s grant that there really is a low probability of crashing in this scenario (though, the argument could still be made without this assumption, using ideas like “bounded rationality”), and that it is indeed really bad for Doug to be late, so that the expected utility to Doug from making it to the appointment on time outweighs the expected disutility to the rest of society from the low probability of crashing. Then: \\(\\mathbb{E}[u_i(\\mathcal{W}_a)] &gt; \\mathbb{E}[u_i(\\mathcal{W}_{\\neg a})]\\), and \\(a\\) is the ethically “correct” choice under this form of the Utilitarian antecedent\nFor the Kantian approach, speeding would not be admissible, since, e.g., [there are huge huge leaps of inference here, that you would usually have to sto and justify one-by-one… I’m simplifying for the sake of finishing this writeup, sryy] everyone speeding whenever they’re late would give rise to a world filled with a way higher likelihood of car crashes than we already have now, in turn raising the likelihood of crashes which would severely negatively affect Doug specifically (which is the crucial consideration, since we’re just back at utilitarianism if we judge based on overall likelihood of crashes). In Kant’s way of arguing, he would then proceed like: since humans cannot rationally will a rule deleterious to themselves8, speeding is inadmissible due to it failing the categorical imperative."

Does this sound relevant to something we are also concerned with in this class? That’s right: Laws! Policies! More on this connection coming soon (around week… 10ish)."

(I’ve never seen this movie, but, from what I understand it zaps people’s brains to basically overwrite their memories of something!) The Brain Zapper is like a Neuralyzer but with two screens on it, as described below.↩︎\nNotice my sleight-of-hand here: Why wouldn’t the rule be “Put Ranch Dressing on any salad”, or “Put Ranch Dressing on all food”, for example? This is called the “Problem of Relevant Descriptions”, and you can find a summary in Timmons (1997) or (even better imo) the chapter on Kant in Russell (1946)↩︎\nExistentialism, a not-that-different ethical theory that draws on Kant, would make it a point to add Religion to the list of inadmissible-because-externally-given criteria/sources of motivation. We’ll come back to Existentialism at the very end of the semester!↩︎\nThis is basically where Rawls got the “Veil of Ignorance” idea from — a point he himself readily admits in Rawls (1980)!↩︎\nFor our purposes, you can just read ”maxim” as ”rule”. In non-oversimplified-Kant-world they’re technically not the same!↩︎\nFinal footnote here: Kant often has to hedge at this point and say things like, humans can rationally will a rule which seems deleterious to themselves, but is not actually deleterious to themselves, due to their intrinsic valuation of e.g. fairness, which cancels out the “vulgar” idea that $9.01 for me and $0 for you is better than $9 for me and $9 for you. But, for this specific example, we don’t need to bring in fairness/inequality, since we are directly “drilling down to” Doug’s aversion to being hit by a car, rather than aversion to unfairness or inequality between car-hitting chances.↩︎"

    "section": "2. Linguistic Relativism, Linguistic Determinism, and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis",
    "text": "2. Linguistic Relativism, Linguistic Determinism, and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis\nHonestly, this question simmered in my brain from the minute it came up until the end of class! So, from the time class ended up until now, I went back and re-read two of the four books that had put these concepts into my brain in the first place. The two I read were:\n\nMarcel Danesi (2021), Linguistic Relativity Today: Language, Mind, Society, and the Foundations of Linguistic Anthropology (Danesi 2021) [PDF; this one is particularly difficult and expensive to obtain a hard copy of!]\nJohn McWhorter (2014), The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language (McWhorter 2014): This one I did explicitly mention in class and put it on the slides [EPUB]\n\nWhile the two I didn’t re-read, but did impact my brain at some earlier point, were:\n\nSteven Pinker (2005), The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature (Pinker 2005) [EPUB]\nGeorge Lakoff (1987), Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal about the Mind (Lakoff 1987) [PDF]\n\nBesides the time factor, the reason I only re-read the first two is because: (a) I remember feeling like the Pinker book was overly dismissive of the whole idea; as in, I don’t feel like it gave a very “fair trial” to the nuances of the degrees to which language and thought affect one another. And (b) Lakoff’s books are… I feel like I should like them, the specific topics he looks at are fascinating and relevant and important imo, but then when I actually open them up and read them I often feel like the writing is a bit dry and monotonous1.\nAnd, my followup thought on this is: I was too dismissive of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis! One of the reasons I settled on the Danesi book at spot #1 is because, I think it does a really good job of separating the strong and weak forms of this hypothesis, and it matches 100% with how Cynthia summarized it in class! So, I hereby delegate Cynthia as the class consultant for language in data ethics and society 😎. The summary I can come up with, trying to synthesize what Cynthia said and how it’s described in the Danesi book, is that:\n\nLinguistic Determinism, or the Strong Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, posits that “language determines how people think” (Danesi 2021, x), whereas\nLinguistic Relativism, or the Weak Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, posits that language shapes (without determining) how people think.\n\nBasically, the Danesi book’s preface mentions the strong version but quickly dismisses it: “From the relevant studies, there is little support for the so-called ‘strong’ version” (Danesi 2021, x). The first chapter then goes in-depth into the weak version, in a really fascinating way.\nI was taking the term “Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis” in general and conflating it with the strong version, and that’s where my criticism was coming from. I should have phrased what I was saying as: the strong Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis can be problematic, from my perspective, given the implications that could come from believing it to be true when it isn’t.\nIn its strong form, for example, it strikes me as alarmingly reminiscent of Samuel Huntington’s Clash of Civilizations hypothesis (and the many similar and similarly-influential global-cultural claims), which have the effect of telling policymakers something like “we’ll never be able to bridge the humongous gap between ‘Eastern’ and ‘Western’ cultures, so they’ll just have to eternally clash with one another, and uh, I hope ‘we’ win!”\nThis is the kind of danger that, in my reading, McWhorter is warning about in the Language Hoax book whose cover was in my slides: just that, we have to be very careful when talking about concepts as fuzzy and hard-to-define as “a culture” or “a language” since, despite their vagueness in theory, they can become reified and morph into dehumanizing claims and then entire books about e.g. the “Arab mind”, and then these kinds of books can hypothetically become “the basis of” one’s “cultural instruction” in the US Army, with predictable consequences…\n\n“At the institution where I teach military officers,”” as retired U.S. Army Col. Norvell De Atkine writes in the book’s foreword, “The Arab Mind forms the basis of my cultural instruction.” (from Slate, “Inside The Arab Mind: What’s wrong with the White House’s book on Arab nationalism”)\n\nWith that said, I don’t think there’s anything in Whorf’s original description of the idea that lends itself to this kind of cultural essentialism! I think the following quote from Whorf, quoted at the beginning of the Danesi book, makes the distinction really clear:\n\nWe are thus introduced to a new principle of relativity, which holds that all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated. (Whorf 1956, 229)\n\nBasically, this quote is how I’ll remember Sapir-Whorf as linguistic relativism, rather than determinism, from now on!"

    "text": "3. Mental Math Speed as an Example of Weak Sapir-Whorf\nThe example that came up during that same discussion—where Keqin helped a ton by pointing out the syllabic differences in mathematical symbols/terms between different languages!—I think was first implanted in my brain by a 2014 article from the Wall Street Journal, “The Best Language for Math: Confusing English Number Words Are Linked to Weaker Skills” (Shellenbarger 2014), that went 2014-style viral, or at least viral among… cross-cultural linguistics nerds?\nI tried to find the presentation (or at least the paper) about the cross-cultural mental math experiments that I went to while I was at the Santa Fe Institute, but I wasn’t able to track it down. And, I found it surprisingly difficult to find actual scientific studies of it more generally2. However, I did find a super-interesting deep-dive into aspects of the original Wall Street Journal article, and an even more super-interesting book:\n\nBarbara M. Birch and Sean Fulop (2021), English L2 Reading: Getting to the Bottom (4th Edition) (Birch and Fulop 2021) [PDF]\n\nwhich goes into an awesome amount of analytic detail about second-language learning. It even has a neural network diagram right in the first chapter, which is how I knew I had to read it 🤓:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our purposes, though, the two most interesting parts of that book come at the end of Chatper 2 and then… the entirety of Chapter 3, which is on “Interlanguage Reading and Transfer”. As a segue into this chapter, which contains a bunch of material on studies of mental math, the end of Chapter 2 presents the following as its fourth “Discussion Question”, which I wanted to copy here as a “food for thought” exercise for you, having had our discussion around mental math and language!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMental Math Discussion Question (Birch and Fulop 2021, 50–51)\n\n\n\nThis quote comes from Tzeng and Hung (1981): “Miller … has pointed out the importance of notational design in the history of mathematics. In Miller’s words (1957) ‘In order to study the interaction of thought and symbol it is not necessary to travel with Whorf to the Zuni Indians; the language of mathematics is rich with excellent examples. Why are Arabic numbers so superior to Roman?’” (p. 238).\nIn that spirit, compare these different representations of the same meaning concept (the number seven): 7, seven, vii. Which type of writing does each correspond to? (If 7 and vii are both logographic, what is the difference between them?) What are the advantages and disadvantages of each type of number? Do you agree that the history of mathematics has been affected by the type of notations developed? Could mathematics have advanced without the symbols like 7?\nCould language and culture be similarly affected by the writing systems that evolved in different civilizations? Logan (1986) argues that alphabetic writing was related to the growth of theoretical science in Western civilization and not in Eastern: “The effects of the alphabet and the abstract, logical, systematic thought that it encouraged explain why science began in the West and not in the East, despite the much greater technological sophistication of the Chinese […] the inventors of metallurgy, irrigation systems, animal harnesses, paper, ink” (p. 23).\n\n\nThen, the section of Chapter 3 with the title “Writing Systems and Transfer” contains the “meat” of the question, with references to individual studies you can read for a true deep-dive (including a study that very specifically looks at Hong Kong ESL learners! For those interested: (Yeung, Siegel, and Chan 2013)).\nI’m copying that section of the chapter in full below, so that you have the previous “discussion question” and this section all in one place, and you don’t have to worry about going and obtaining the full book if you don’t want to! (This one is collasped by default, to make the page look less scarily-long)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWriting Systems and Transfer (Birch and Fulop 2021, 63–65)\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting Systems and Transfer\nOne question that researchers have tried to answer is whether logograms like Chinese characters or Japanese kanji are read holistically or not. There was early evidence for this idea because reading logograms was more like processing pictures than reading (Henderson 1982, 196). Morton and Sasanuma (1984) concluded that for Japanese writing, although the kana were read analytically, the kanji were read holistically. To them, there seems to be “a strong dissociation between the processes involved in reading the two scripts [kana vs. kanji]” (p. 40). However, Leong and Tamaoka (1995) argued that both visual and phonological processing occur in accessing difficult kanji with phonetic elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading Logograms\nKoda (1995) explained how both holistic and phonological processing are involved in reading logograms. Koda suggested that all writing systems require readers to access phonological information because working memory is better for phonological material than for visual material. However, the timing of the phonological access is different. Alphabetic writing requires access to a phonological representation prior to or at the time that the word is retrieved from memory. A logographic code requires phonological access only after the word is retrieved because that is the time when phonological information becomes available to the reader, as shown in Figure 3.1. It is, in fact, impossible to pronounce an unknown character because often the phonetic cues are not enough. Logograms may also be read without access to sound, as in mental math calculations, where thinking of the name of the number symbol slows down the process. This evidence supports the claim that readers use different linguistic strategies to handle logograms (holism) vs. alphabetic words (analysis) but that the universal phonological principle does hold.\nTan et al. (2003) studied intermediate Chinese/English graduate students who began learning English after the age of 12, comparing them with a group of English monolinguals. They found that phonological processing of Chinese characters activates portions of the brain that process spatial information. The activation of this system was related to the square configuration of the character, which then maps onto a monosyllabic unit of speech. When the Chinese students performed a phonological task on English words, they activated the very same visual processing system, unlike the brain areas activated by the English monolinguals when they performed phonemic analyses.\nTan et al. (2003) thought that their Chinese subjects were trying to use their L1 system to read in English. Since they lacked the infrastructure for English, they could not process the alphabetic writing system like the English readers did. In other words, the Chinese graduate students were not taking advantage of the alphabetic writing. However, little is known about their background as language learners. Yeung, Siegel, and Chan (2013, 699) found that if Chinese-speaking children gained in phonological awareness, their reading also improved. They suggested that “once children acquire phoneme awareness, even without explicit instruction in letter-sound correspondences, they change the reading strategy and readily apply the phoneme awareness to aid word recognition.”\nKoda (1995) studied Japanese, Arabic, Spanish, and English readers of English and found that symbols that had no phonological cues and unpronounceable words interfered less with the Japanese readers than with the alphabetic readers. Unpronounceable words interfere with English reading because of the difficulty they pose for phonological analysis. English readers stumble over the unpronounceable foreign names in a novel like War and Peace. They try to process them holistically by remembering the appearance of the name and associating it with a certain character. Or they try a laborious analytical strategy of sounding out the names and remembering them by sound. Either way, they are obstacles for reading.\nHowever, unpronounceable words did not cause difficulty for the Japanese readers that Koda (1995) studied because they treated the problem words as they did kanji. They did not try to pronounce them; they tried to remember them visually. Also, English reading comprehension among Japanese college students was unaffected by the unpronounceability of English words, suggesting a strategy of relying little on phonological information in reading the unknown words. The strategy these Japanese students were applying to unknown English words was holistic, visual, and meaning-based, discarding the very strengths of the alphabetic writing system with its cues to sound. The short-term strategy of treating unfamiliar words as logograms may assist English beginning readers at first, but over time, it is more efficient to decode unknown words and assign a pronunciation to them. In short, there is evidence for transfer of processing strategies from L1 to L2 if the writing systems have some similarity such as Chinese characters, Japanese kanji, and symbols or unpronounceable words. This is facilitation, but it may only offer a short-term benefit"

    "text": "Achieving Intersubjective “Truth”\nI (thankfully) remembered to describe Quine’s “gavagai” problem in class today, where the takeaway was that we never technically “know” the meaning of a word in a definitive sense—we are always “triangulating” the meaning by collecting more and more “data” in the form of contexts in which we observe the word being used. In the gavagai example from class, we have the following process of narrowing-in on the meaning of “gavagai”:\n\nA rabbit runs by, and a member of the group whose language we don’t know points at the rabbit and says “gavagai!” \\(\\leadsto\\) “gavagai” could mean “rabbit”, or “furry animal”, or “thing with legs”, or “thing with less than 5 legs”, or “thing with less than 6 legs”, or “thing with less than 7 legs”, etc… (an infinitude of possible meanings)\nLater that day, someone from the same linguistic community points at a table with 6 legs and says “gavagai!” \\(\\leadsto\\) we can now eliminate the “rabbit” and “furry animal” hypotheses, as well as the “thing with less than 5 legs” and “thing with less than 6 legs” hypotheses.\nWe continue this (when it comes to our first language, it’s a process running from early childhood onwards), such that we (asymptotically) converge to a fairly stable distribution of how likely and unlikely we think the different hypotheses are.\n\nOne thing that emerges, though, is that we can also start to “mark out” different classes of words, spanning from:\n\nThose which are easiest to achieve intersubjective agreement on, such as the words in a sentence like: “this table is taller than that table”, which can be intersubjectively verified by allowing all the subjects to e.g. use their depth perception and/or a meter stick to measure the two tables (our distribution of hypotheses around these words converge to a stable state pretty quickly), to\nThose which are more difficult because we don’t have an intersubjectively-agreed meter stick, like “I love you more than they love you”: words whose subjective meanings (i.e., our distributions of hypotheses about what these words refer to or demarcate in the world) are frequently challenged and updated as we grow and have more experiences; these latter cases are why I wish I could’ve played this full video that I summarized in class!"

    "text": "Essentially-Contested Terms\nIf this was just a class on the language of ethics, we could in a sense stop there (for example, the range of language covered in the above two bullet points corresponds to a large chunk of the linguistic theory in Hare (1952)). But, in a class where the point of all this is to build up frameworks for ethics and policy, we can posit a third type of word, which Connolly (1974) calls an “essentially contested” word or concept.\nThe easiest way to understand what might qualify as an “essentially contested” word is probably through example. So, as the first example that comes to my mind, consider how US schools usually ask students to stand up at the beginning of each school day, put their hands to their hearts, and recite the Pledge of Allegiance, which ends with the phrase:\n\nWith liberty and justice for all.\n\nSo, we can take the two bolded words there, and we can think about how it’s probably going to be more difficult to achieve intersubjective agreement about what these terms mean to people in the US than, say, “fish” or “pencil”, precisely because there are higher stakes: intersubjective disagreements about what “liberty” and “justice” mean cut straight to the core of what it means to be “American” in a way that disagreements about “fish” or “pencil” do not.\nThis idea can also help shed light on how, for example, the relationship between political power and the degree of linkage one can establish between one’s own political program and the meanings of these words. To put it in a less wordy way: the success of a political party often correlates with how well it can “fit” its own program to particular subjective meanings of these terms held among constituents. So that, in the US, there are political struggles in which debates (usually implicitly, but sometimes explicitly) are waged over how the politician will uphold the “liberty” and “justice” that is in constituents’ heads better than their opponents.\nOr, to make it less US-centric, someone in China may succeed or fail to succeed in enacting some sort of change in the system to the extent that they can link their program with a particular meaning of 中国特色社会主义 or socialism (社会主义) with Chinese characteristics (中国特色)—a term which appears many times in this famous 2013 speech from Xi Jinping, for example, which has the title (using my terrible Chinese translation skills but I think I got this bc I cross-checked it with the English translation):\n\n毫不动摇坚持和发展中国特色社会主义\n(Uphold and Extend Socialism with Chinese Characteristics)\n\nand which makes the argument that (using my terrible Chinese comprehension skills to their maximum degree here, since I didn’t cross-check the whole thing), the tenets of Xi Jinping Thought that are outlined in the speech are a “best” implementation of 中国特色社会主义, among ideas/proposals being discussed at the end of Hu Jintao’s term as CCP General Secretary in 2012."

    "text": "Policy Whitepaper Takeaway: Operationalize!\nThe takeaway from these two examples to your policy whitepapers, therefore, can be summarized like: you’re going to make your task harder than it needs to be if you say that (e.g.) your policy is better than existing policies because it better upholds “liberty”, or “justice”, or “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics”, as such… For someone to accept that type of argument, they would probably also have to share a whole lot of other “background” antecedents with you in the first place, about what these terms mean, which would kind of undercut the point of making the argument (you would be “preaching to the choir”).\nSo, this means that I might circle some part(s) of your proposals for example and write “essentially contested concept!”, meaning, you probably need to operationalize what you mean, more concretely, by specifying a metric on which your policy might be better, if you want to convince people in your audience who don’t already agree with you!\nAs a final two-bullet-point example, consider the Drèze and Sen (1991) example from the Week 2 slides, where we looked at this passage:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point there was that, if you want to say e.g. that your policy would increase freedom, then you can first specify freedom from hunger to “decouple” this type of freedom from “freedom” writ large. But, even then, you should also specify whether your operationalization of “hunger” is:\n\nLiteral starvation, in the form of e.g. deaths that occur over a short period of time due to acute famine conditions (like the Great Famine referenced in the above passage), or\nNutritional deprivation, in the form of e.g. the longer-term effects of subsistence-level food and water, and the deaths that occur over a longer span of time that wouldn’t have otherwise occurred with an above-subsistence-level food and water intake."

And, to this end, it will not be graded, which we hope will further cement the idea that it is not a judgement process, but a working-together process to arrive at a plan for getting the project done.\nTo conclude, concretely: you’ll be “done” with the proposal stage once you and your mentor are on the same page in terms of\n\nWhat topic you’re going to pursue,\nWhat your final deliverable will look like, and\nA set of milestones you will use from now until the beginning of May to track your progress.\n\nAt that point, you’ll be ready for the implementation stage, described in the next section.",

    "text": "The Implementation Stage\nThis stage is more difficult to describe in advance, since it depends on the specific topic you’ll pursue. But, the main goal is for you to have a draft version of the project ready by Wednesday, April 24th. We choose this date specifically because it corresponds to the final lecture in the course, so that as part of that lecture Jeff can make sure to touch on any remaining issues that might still need to be tackled in order to move from the draft to the submission on the last day of the semester.\nHowever, given this explanation, hopefully it makes sense that the earlier you have a draft, the better, since an earlier draft means that Jeff can also use the lectures before the final lecture to cover any topics which might be relevant to your projects! In other words: the whole reason why the last few lectures of the course are set aside as “Selected Topics” is so that these lectures can adapt to cover whatever might be relevant and important for the range of topics yall choose for your final projects! So, please take advantage of this aspect of the class if you can.",

    "section": "Example Project Ideas",
    "text": "Example Project Ideas\nNow that you have all of the above info, we wanted to make it clear that it’s okay if you don’t have any idea of what topic you’d like to pursue for the project! Some people come into the course with a very particular interest, whereas others come in for the sake of learning a broad overview of a bunch of topics, and we’re here to accommodate both cases 😁 So, if you don’t have a preexisting idea of what you’d like to pursue, in this section we provide you with a few examples—one example per course topic—that you can choose as-is or modify to suit your interests.\nAs you’ll quickly see if you start reading through the examples, there are tons and tons of details and tons and tons of variations/modifications that could be made, that I’m unable to state in detail without making this a 1000-page document 😜 so, just keep in mind that if anything at all pops into your head while reading through them, even if the thing that pops into your head doesn’t “match” the specific details of one of the projects here, that’s a good thing! You can take that and run with it, turning it from an idea into a full-blown project by talking through it with your mentor.\n\nHigh-Level Data Science Questions\n\nExample 1: Archive of Missing Datasets\nHere there are tons of possibilities for each “sub-topic” that we covered during the broad overview of data science issues given in Week 1 and Week 2. But, one that I think could be interesting and relevant to the policy-focused goal of the final project would be to pursue the idea of the Archive of Missing Datasets:\nYou may have found, when working on your own projects or the DSAN 5000/5100 projects, that there are lots of datasets that you assume must exist somewhere, but you then find to your horror that they actually don’t exist, at least not in a form that would allow for a useful/informative data analysis.\nSo, if you have experienced this, or if you haven’t but you’re interested in discovering what might be egregious/socially-important cases of missing datasets, your final project could revolve around recommending to policymakers that they invest in (as in, allocate resources towards in general, not just money!) the creation of a currently non-existent dataset.\nThis is precisely what has motivated one of the biggest society-wide DSAN 5450-related developments in the US of recent years: in the aftermath of the sudden publicity that rampant police murder of black people across the country received because of cases like the murders of\n\nTrayvon Martin in Florida,\nFreddie Gray in Baltimore, Maryland,\nMichael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri,\nEric Garner in Staten Island, New York,\nGeorge Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and\nPhilando Castile in St. Paul, Minnesota,\n\nmany people were shocked to learn that the US government doesn’t care enough to keep track of these killings in any systematic way, which led to data-journalistic endeavors like the Washington Post’s “Fatal Force” police killings database.\nOnce these endeavors were established, however, the next “phase” of policy debates on this issue have revolved around whether and/or how data on these types of socially-important phenomena should in fact be collected by publicly-funded government institutions, given that (in this case) the police officers doing the killings are themselves publicly-funded government employees.\nSo, as an example final project on this issue of missing datasets, you could:\n\nIdentify another such socially-important phenomenon for which there is a dearth of available data that would be helpful for some social goal,\nDocument the details around what data already exists regarding this phenomenon (descriptively), and why it is insufficient from a social perspective (normatively), and then\nArgue that the policymaking audience of your project should in fact allocate resources towards the collection of this data (note the shift from descriptive to normative here!): for example, you would need to argue for the feasibility of this collection—providing concrete details about precisely how it could be implemented, in a cost-effective manner, given some budget—as well as its effectiveness with respect to some explicitly-stated social goal (like, in the above example, the goal could simply be to reduce the frequency of police killings).\n\n\n\nExample 2: Operationalization\nIn the Week 1 slides I included a brief discussion of operationalization in terms of a book by \"\"\"Nobel Prize\"\"\"-winning economists2 Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen called Mismeasuring our Lives: Why GDP Doesn’t Add Up (Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi 2010). This example project outline is sort of a “variation” of Example 1, since basically what I would recommend if you’re interested in this topic would be very similar:\nWhereas the goal of the Archive of Missing Datasets is to point out how there is lots of socially-important information that is not measured at all, Stiglitz and Sen are pointing to equally-urgent and equally-deleterious (often way more urgent/deleterious!) cases where the information is measured, but where the way that it is measured is harmful with respect to the social goal which motivated the measurement in the first place.\nSo, we can take the description of Example 1 above, and basically just replace “missing” with “badly measured”, to see how a project studying operationalization could work:\n\nIdentify a socially-important phenomenon for data does exist but is measured in a way that is relatively unhelpful/non-useful with respect to some social goal (that is, relative to another way of measuring it which could be mroe helpful/useful),\nDocument the details around what data already exists regarding this phenomenon (descriptively), and why it is unhelpful for measuring the social phenomena of interest (normatively), and then\nArgue that the policymaking audience of your project should in fact allocate resources towards the better operationalization that you are proposing (note the shift from descriptive to normative here!): for example, you would need to argue for the feasibility of this new measure—providing concrete details about precisely how it could be implemented, in a cost-effective manner, given some budget—as well as its greater effectiveness than previous ways of measuring, with respect to some explicitly-stated social goal (like, in the earlier example, reducing the frequency of police killings).\n\nAs you can maybe tell by now, the “boundary” between missing data and badly-measured data is sometimes fuzzy: for example, often data-policy debates will say that a certain dataset is missing as shorthand for something more like “it’s measured so badly that, for all intents and purposes it may as well be missing”.\nFor example, technically (until 2019) the FBI used to issue what were called Uniform Crime Reports, but these were based on a “voluntary-reporting” model, meaning that individual police departments could submit whatever data they wanted, and withhold whatever data they wanted, without explanation or documentation, so… from what I can tell, after 2019 they just gave up, since a voluntary-reporting dataset of crime certainly falls under the rubric of may-as-well-be-missing. But, alas, these reports are still used widely in various academic studies of crime, books, journalistic investigations, etc., so if that’s at all interesting to you, it could be studied for a final project that would treat it as a mixture of the missing data and badly-operationalized data issues.\n\n\n\nFairness\nAs we discussed in Week 4 (specifically, I wrote it on the chalkboard and talked through it as an example, on the basis of stuff in those W04 slides), one of the most high-profile cases of algorithmic discrimination in the 21st century emerged out of the ProPublica vs. Northpointe Scandal.\nThe rough summary is that:\n\nAlthough ProPublica meticulously documented anti-black racial discrimination in Northpointe’s COMPAS algorithm in terms of the classification parity fairness measure,\nNorthepointe then responded by meticulously documenting the absence of anti-black racial discrimination in COMPAS in terms of the predictive parity fairness measure\n\nSo, since this is one of the most-often-analyzed datasets in the Fairness in AI literature, your final project could be to pursue this case in a more in-depth way than we were able to cover it in class. This would involve writing a policy paper with two main parts:\n\nExplaining the ProPublica-Northpointe controversy descriptively, by demonstrating how the data simultaneously violates classification parity fairness while satisfying predictive parity fairness. Specifically, this would mean:\n\nExplaining the two fairness definitions to an audience of policymakers and then\nWriting Python or R code which downloads the data and evluates it programmatically on these two different fairness criteria\n\nEvaluating the ProPublic-Northpointe controversy normatively, by providing recommendations for policymakers in terms of how they ought to adjudicate this case. There are several ways you could approach this, but the first two example approaches that come to mind are:\n\nArguing that one of these two fairness criteria better “aligns” with an ethical framework that you think the policymakers should adopt—for example, you could adopt utilitarianism as your ethical “axiom”, and then argue that one of these criteria is more appropriate for evaluating outcomes than the other, and therefore better suited to resolving the dispute in a utilitarian manner\nArguing that neither of the two fairness criteria are sufficient for policymaking, and arguing that policymakers should instead use a framework like \\(\\varepsilon\\)-based fairness or causal fairness to resolve the dispute.\n\n\n\n\nCausality\nAn example project on this topic could pursue the type of approach that appeared on your Homework 2, in Part 3.3, which presented two different hypotheses regarding the causal mechanism by which women experience worse mental health outcomes. You don’t need to pursue this particular question, or use these particular variables in your causal model! But, I am copying some of the key parts of that problem here, along with explanations of how you could pursue this type of analysis in a more in-depth way for a final project.\nThe homework problem presented a simplified version of a causal system studied using causal diagrams in Chapter 16 of Kaufman and Oakes (2006): Glymour (2006), “Using Causal Diagrams to Understand Common Problems in Social Epidemiology”. The idea was to consider an imaginary debate (though one that happens between real people all the time, when taking about this issue!) between:\n\nPerson \\(i\\), who hypothesizes that women have greater rates of depression because they are “‘biologically programmed’ to be depressed” (ibid., pg. 408), and\nPerson \\(j\\), who hypothesizes that women have greater rates of depression because\n\n\n“People get depressed whenever they are sexually harassed” (ibid.), and\n\n\n“Women are more frequently sexually harassed than men” (ibid.)\n\n\n\nIt then took this debate and tried to “zero in” on the particular variables that came into play in the respective arguments:\n\n\\(A\\): The gender of an individual (as before, conceptualized as their self-reported and/or socially-expressed gender), where \\(A = 1\\) for self-reported females and \\(A = 0\\) for those who do not self-report as female\n\\(B\\): An indicator variable representing some biological property of the individual (in these debates, this would most commonly be e.g. \\(B = 1\\) for the presence of at least one Y-chromosome and \\(B = 0\\) otherwise)\n\\(H\\): Whether or not someone experiences sexual harassment, where \\(H = 1\\) represents that the individual has experienced such harassment and \\(H = 0\\) represents that they have not experienced it\n\\(Y\\): The “outcome” of whether or not someone has developed depression, where \\(Y = 1\\) represents an individual with depression and \\(Y = 0\\) represents an individual without depression\n\nAnd, once these variables were established, we were able to “encode” the two hypothesized causal pathways within the same causal diagram:\n\n\n\nWe then looked at two subgraphs of the full causal diagram, with the following subgraph representing person \\(i\\)’s hypothesis:\n\n\n\nAnd this alternative subgraph representing person \\(j\\)’s hypothesis:\n\n\n\nSo, for your final project, you could take a debate around a social issue that is particularly important or particularly interesting to you and perform a causal analysis of it using this general framework.\nThe idea would be to choose a topic where you think that detailing the causal connections between variables in this manner could aid policymakers in addressing the underlying problem.\nLots of examples immediately come to mind (though they are Jeff-style examples so you don’t need to choose any of them, I promise! 😜), but throughout the semester many of the examples in class revolved around the causal pathways linking race with policing, incarceration, and the criminal justice system. From the perspective of a policymaker—the perspective you should have in mind for the final project!—some of the key issues that could be analyzed using frameworks from DSAN 5450 would be:\n\nHow do variables related to social conditions (e.g., poverty, quality of schools) causally interact with variables related to individual choices (e.g., searching for a job, pursuing additional years of school, allocating income between saving and spending) to produce outcomes like career “success” (say, moving into a higher or lower income bracket relative to the bracket one is born into), crime, and/or trust in government?\nHow might it help policymakers to think causally, in terms of how different interventions might counterfactually help or harm some goal that they have?\n\nHere you could choose an existing but vague policy debate like “do police and metal detectors in school help or harm students’ educations?”, and make it more concrete by describing a causally-robust study that could be performed to slightly move this debate away from people-yelling-opinions-at-each-other and towards people-studying-the-causal-impacts-of-interventions… If you were actually able to go out and collect data relevant to these debates, and perform a causal analysis using this data, that would be the holy grail! But, I promise, given the timespan you have, a careful and well-thought-out description of what this type of study would look like and how it could be carried out would be sufficient for the project.\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Data Protection Policies\nHere there were a couple of points during Week 8 and Week 9 where I mentioned possible final project ideas, but the first two that come to mind are:\n\nIn this slide during Week 8, I pointed out how there are far too many different data-protection policy frameworks, spanning across too many different countries and states, for me to be able to cover them all. So, your project could be to pursue this further than we were able to in class! But, that’s a bit general, so to make it more specific, the types of projects I briefly outlined in Week 8 were along the lines of:\n\nChoose a country/state that you think is a “policy innovator”, and then see how the data-protection policies from this country/state “diffuse outwards” and get adopted over time by other countries/states. Although one way to do this would be to find a manually-curated dataset which contains (e.g.) 0/1 variables representing whether a given state has adopted a given data-protection policy at a given time (and these datasets definitely exist, and we can help you find them!), to me another cool way to study this would be to use NLP text-reuse detection algorithms like Passim, to “automatically” detect policy adoption by just seeing when text from country \\(A\\)’s data-protection laws appears in another country \\(B\\)’s data-protection laws.\nRather than a diffusion study like this, you could instead carry out what’s called a cross-sectional analysis of countries/states and their data-protection policies: to me, one interesting cross-sectional study could be to see how a country’s form of government relates to the data-protection laws it adopts: are there systematic differences between the data-protection policies adopted by hereditary monarchies in the Middle East like Saudi Arabia or Bahrain and those adopted by comparable (as in, in this case, historically-culturally similar—remember our idea of fair comparison!) Middle Eastern countries with democratic institutions like Yemen or Lebanon?3\n\nOne other potential project I mentioned in both Week 8 and Week 9 would be a project studying how ambiguity is used instrumentally in privacy policies to shift power from users to companies, since these companies possess greater residual rights of control—the right to determine “what happens” when there is ambiguity in a contract—relative to users. The slides for both weeks contained the plot from Wagner (2023) showing the growth in “obfuscatory words” in privacy policies over time, but I also mentioned how the goal of Wagner (2023) was to point out how NLP could be used to try and “combat” the power imbalances induced by this ambiguity.\nSo, one example of a final project pursuing this thread could be a policy paper wherein you code and demonstrate a proof of concept of how a “privacy policy badness detector” could work: it’s the thing I talked about near the beginning of Week 9, where, you could have a user specify their privacy “boundaries”, and then you could have code that uses NLP tools to parse privacy policies to identify statements which might enable the company to violate these boundaries, highlighting them for the user so that they don’t have to read the entire thing manually!\nScope-wise, that would be pretty ambitious, so to me a very reasonable final project could just be a more “naïve” version of this, where users could just specify key terms of interest to them (say, “medical data”), and then maybe the app could be a browser extension which removes all of the parts of the privacy policy besides the parts which may be relevant to the user’s key terms. Then, in your paper, you would want to make an argument to policymakers on the basis of what you “found” in making the app—for example, if you found that there were clauses that were relevant to medical data but where this relevance was “hidden” because of the ambiguity of the language used, then perhaps you could recommend that they pass a law requiring companies to tag each paragraph of their privacy policies with what aspects of privacy they relate to, as a concrete way to ameliorate the “ambiguity problem”!\n\n\n\nPolicy Evaluation / Recommendation\nSince we haven’t covered this yet, I will just provide an example of a policy-evaluation final project in class this week (Week 10), and then I will copy it into this section.",

But the full-on, in-depth essay I’d truly recommend is Yasha Levine’s “It’s all a big lie.

That book points out the gap between the conceptual variable [economic well-being] and its operationalization as [GDP].\n\nSo, for the midterm, we might ask you to consider a conceptual variable like “fairness” or “privacy”, and think through different ways they could be operationalized as measurable quantities.",

    "section": "Part 2: Ethical Frameworks",
    "text": "Part 2: Ethical Frameworks\n\n(2.1) Descriptive vs. Normative\nI think you all did a great job of demonstrating that you understand this distinction, through homeworks and discussions (in class and in office hours)! So, on this topic I think you can just review the basic “gist” of how this works:\nTwo types of Descriptive statements:\n\nNon-implicational statements that describe facts, like \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), are descriptive but indeterminate without a set of axioms (definitions for the symbols, in this case)\nImplicational statements that describe facts, like \\(ZFC \\implies 1 + 1 = 2\\), are descriptive and also determinate (in this case, determinately true)\n\nTwo types of Normative statements:\n\nWhen the statements are not descriptions of empirically/observationally (and intersubjectively) verifiable predicates about how things are (“Grass is green”), but are instead prescriptions of how things ought to be (“Grass ought to be green”/“It is good for grass to be green and bad for grass to be blue”), they have additional normative dimensions\nHowever, in the same way that the descriptive statement \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) goes from indeterminate to determine when we provide a set of axioms, normative statements are also transformed from indeterminate to determinate when we provide an ethical framework within which the normative statement can be evaluated.\n\n\n\n(2.2) Consequentialism vs. Deontological Ethics\nThis portion would also very much involve the two most common concrete versions of these two ethical frameworks:\n\nUtilitarianism as the most common consequentialist framework\nKantian Ethics as the most common deontological-ethical framework\n\nOn the latter two points specifically, I didn’t make the distinction as clearly as I should have in class, so I’m making it here!\nQuestion 2.5 from Homework 1 provided the following statement:\n\n«Lying is bad, since you wouldn’t want others to lie to you.»\n\nAnd then, between Consequentialism and Deontological Ethics, the correct answer was that this statement is more straightforwardly implied by Deontological Ethics. I know this one is particularly difficult to think through, but I wanted to highlight it here because this is the question that really reveals the subtle-but-important distinction between these two systems:\n\nA consequentialist approach to “resolving” a dilemma around lying would, crucially, be based on a prediction of the actual consequences that would result from a possible choice, whereas\nA deontological approach differs from this in considering what makes a possible choice good or bad in-and-of-itself, without reference to the predicted consequences.\n\nThe reason I phrase the distinction in this way is because, in the above statement, you can focus on the portion after the word “since” (“since you wouldn’t want others to lie to you”):\n\nWithin a consequentialist framework, this reasoning would not itself constitute a justification for not lying, since it would have to be paired with a statement like “If I lie, then it is likely that others will lie to me”, which is not true in general! The idiom of a “white lie”, for example, comes precisely from the fact that there are often times when we feel like we should lie to people to avoid the consequence of hurting them.\nWithin a deontological framework, on the other hand, this reasoning would constitute a justification for not lying, since it corresponds precisely to the rule that was mentioned in the prior two questions: Kant’s Categorical Imperative.\nThis Categorical Imperative rule is of special interest, relative to the full set of “ethical rules” you could imagine using, because it is a rule for making ethical decisions without reference to the consequences of a particular choice:\n\nInstead of predicting what might happen if I make this choice, and judging whether it is an ethical choice on that basis…\nI now imagine what would happen hypothetically if everyone else in the world made the choice, whether or not my action would in fact make everyone else in the world make the same choice!\n\n\nI hope that explanation, and the reference to “white lies” as an example, can help make it more clear why the answer to Question 2.5 was “Deontological Ethics”. As one final point, to make it super concrete:\n\nThe reason why the answer is not Consequentialism here is because, a Consequentialist might agree that “I wouldn’t want others to lie to me”, and yet also think “But that’s not a good reason to not lie, since I could lie here without it causing others to lie to me.”\nThat is what would enable “white lies” to be acceptable under consequentialism: since you only consider the predicted consequences of your action in the “real world”, rather than in a hypothetical world where everyone does the same action, you are then able to move to a comparison of whether the benefits of lying outweigh the costs of lying, as one way to make the decision (by “calculating” the consequences!).",

    "section": "Part 3: Context-Free Fairness and Proxy Variables",
    "text": "Part 3: Context-Free Fairness and Proxy Variables\nHere the main idea will be to think through the fairness definitions introduced in this part:\n\nFairness Through Unawareness (Removing “sensitive” variables from the dataset)\nFairness as Equalized Positive Rate\nFairness as Equalized False Positive Rate\nFairness as Equalized False Negative Rate\nFairness as Calibration\n\nAnd especially to be able to understand the “simple” cases when these might work, but also the non-simple cases where these fail to capture what we’d like a robust / actually-usable fairness measure to capture. Some straightforward questions to guide you in this thinking for this part would be, e.g.:\n\nCan we have all of these measures at once?\n\nShort answer: No. But, you should also have some degree of intuition from class about why we can’t (the impossibility results)\n\nThe first four are probably more straightforward, as things we can achieve by dropping variables (Unawarness) or by reading the entries in a confusion matrix. Calibration, however, requires a bit more thought:\n\nHow is calibration defined? The most succinct definition would just be: the requirement that the value of the risk score \\(r(X)\\) that “underlies” the decision-making algorithm (in that it is used to produce our predictions \\(\\widehat{Y}\\)) is itself a probability value—namely, the probability that a person with attributes \\(X\\) has associated outcome \\(Y\\).\nWhy is calibration desirable? Why does it help us in terms of assessing fairness? The definition in the previous bullet point is not very easy-to-understand (to me, at least), so that I interpret it as just a requirement that the risk score “tracks” the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in a direct way: for example, high values of \\(\\Pr(Y \\mid X)\\) mean high values of the underlying representation \\(r(X)\\) that is used to generate \\(\\widehat{Y}\\) as a prediction of \\(Y\\).\nViewed in this way, then, I hope it makes sense that this property would be desirable in terms of interpretability: it means that, if we wanted to know why our prediction algorithm was producing some specific prediction \\(\\widehat{Y}_i\\) for a person with attributes \\(X_i\\), we could “open up the black box” of the algorithm and look directly at the risk score \\(r(X_i)\\) with respect to the risk score function \\(r(\\cdot)\\) in general, to see why it produced such a high/low value of \\(\\widehat{Y}_i\\).\nI know even that last point can still be confusing, so to me the final “piece” for understanding is to think about how: if we didn’t have calibration, then we would have no natural way of interpreting the risk function \\(r(\\cdot)\\). Since without calibration it is not constrained to represent a probability, it could take on any value—\\(\\pi\\), \\(-1000\\), \\(\\sqrt{2^{100}}\\)—and we would have no way of knowing the relationship between these values and the resulting predictions \\(\\widehat{Y}\\); no way of knowing, for example, why plugging in a person with characteristics \\(X_i\\) produced \\(r(X_i) = \\pi\\) which then led to the prediction \\(\\widehat{Y}_i = 1\\), to detain this person until trial!",

    "section": "Part 4: Context-Sensitive Fairness",
    "text": "Part 4: Context-Sensitive Fairness\nWe spent some amount of time critiquing the fairness definitions mentioned in the previous section. This was not for the sake of judging whether they’re “good” or “bad” as such, but rather, for the sake of understanding specifically what they’re missing. Two different characterizations of what they’re missing give us our two key context-sensitive approaches to fairness, discussed in the next two sections:\n\n(4.1) Individual-Similarity-Based Fairness\n\nThe Context-Free measures fail to consider how satisfying a criterion (e.g., Equalized False Positive Rate) at a group level could trample over the rights of individuals.\n\nThe illustration of this failure that I mentioned in class boiled down to:\n\nLet \\(A_i\\) represent a sensitive attribute of individuals, such that \\(A_i = 0\\) if person \\(i\\) is white, and \\(A_i = 1\\) if person \\(i\\) is black.\nIf a police department finds itself failing to satisfy a fairness criterion like Equality of Positive Rates, in the sense that their arrest rate \\(r_1\\) for individuals with \\(A_i = 1\\) is higher than their arrest rate \\(r_0\\) for individuals with \\(A_i = 0\\), then…\nThey can quickly “resolve” this failure and satisfy the criterion by running outside and arresting the first \\(N\\) white people they see, where \\(N\\) is the number of additional white arrestees that would be necessary to make \\(r_0 = r_1\\).\n\nHowever, as this illustration hopefully makes clear, this procedure would allow satisfaction of the group-level fairness criterion, but only at the expense of violating our intuitive notions of fairness towards individuals.\nAlthough there are lots and lots of ways that this notion of individual-level fairness could be incorporated into the Context-Free fairness measures to make them Context-Sensitive, one of the most popular and straightforward ways is by constructing an indiviudal-similarity-based fairness measure, and then using it to constrain the space of possible decisions by enforcing the rule that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFairness Through Awareness (Dwork et al. 2011)\n\n\n\nIndividuals who are similar with respect to a task should be classified similarly.\n\n\nThe first thing I want you to note about this approach is that it specifically aims to resolve the issue we’ve already seen with utilitarianism, namely, that * Optimizing society-level desiderata (like “overall happiness”) may lead to * individuals being brutally mistreated (e.g., having their rights violated)\nYou can also hopefully see how this notion (Fairness Through Awarness) could provide a Rawls-style ordering: individual fairness lexically prior to group-level fairness (optimize group-level fairness once individual-level is satisfied).\nThen lastly, as you saw on HW2, this general notion of Fairness Through Awareness can be operationalized as a measurable quantity by, for example, implementing what is generally called metric fairness: Given a similarity metric \\(m: \\mathcal{I} \\times \\mathcal{I} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) is the set of all individuals,\n\\[\n|D_i - D_j| \\leq m(i, j)\n\\]\nfor all pairs of individuals \\((i, j)\\). Or in other words, that the difference between the decisions \\(D_i\\) and \\(D_j\\) should be bounded above by the similarity \\(m(i,j)\\) between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\).\nThis, to me, is already slightly more than you need to know for the midterm, but if you want to dive into this Context-Sensitive approach specifically, Section 5.1 of Mitchell et al. (2021) has a really great discussion of Metric Fairness specifically.",

So, I don’t recommend the whole thing (that’s why there are two more Roemer books in this section, which are more applied looks at particular ethical frameworks!)\nThe two parts we will draw on, which I do therefore recommend, are the explanations of utility functions in Chapter 1 and of Social Welfare Functionals in Chapter 4\n\n\n\n\nParticular Examples / Frameworks\n\nRoemer (1988), Free to Lose: An Introduction to Marxist Economic Philosophy [PDF]\nAnderson (2017), Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (And Why We Don’t Talk About It) [PDF] [EPUB] [MOBI]\nRawls (1971), A Theory of Justice [PDF]\nRoemer (1998), Equality of Opportunity [PDF]",
