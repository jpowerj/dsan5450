# Metaethics {data-stack-name="Metaethics"}

A scary-sounding word that just means:

> "What we talk about when we talk about ethics",

in contrast to

> "What we talk about when we talk about [insert particular ethical framework here]"

## Reflective Equilibrium {.crunch-title .text-90}

* Most criticisms of any framework boil down to, "great in theory, but doesn't work in practice"
* The way to take this seriously: **reflective equilibrium** 
* Introduced by @rawls_outline_1951, but popularized by @rawls_theory_1971

* Big changes in history are associated with changes in this **good/bad labeling**!
* Max Weber ([second most cited](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Top-50-sociologists-according-to-aggregate-weighted-citation-scores-normalized-score_fig1_332447162') sociologist ever\*): *Protestant value system* enabled *capitalist system* by **relabeling what things are good vs. bad** [@weber_protestant_1904]:

## Contemporary Example: Palestine {.text-65 .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote .crunch-li .crunch-p}

* Very few of the relevant **empirical** facts are in dispute, since opening of crucial archives to three so-called "New Historians" in the 1980s. So why do people still argue?

::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#pappe-text}

* **Ilan Pappe**, one of these historians, concluded from this material that:
  * The Israeli state was built upon a massive ethnic cleansing, and
  * Is not morally justifiable [@pappe_ethnic_2006]

> The immunity Israel has received over the last fifty years encourages others, regimes and oppositions alike, to believe that human and civil rights are irrelevant in the Middle East. The dismantling of the mega-prison in Palestine will send a different, and more hopeful, message.

:::
::: {#morris-text}

* **Benny Morris**, another of these historians, concluded that:
  * The Israeli state was built upon a massive ethnic cleansing, and
  * Is morally justifiable [@morris_birth_1987]

> A Jewish state would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 Palestinians. Therefore it was necessary to uproot them. There was no choice but to expel that population. It was necessary to cleanse the hinterland and cleanse the border areas and cleanse the main roads.

<!-- [...] The term "cleanse" doesn't sound nice but that's the term they used at the time. I adopted it from the 1948 documents. -->

## One Solution: Individual Rights {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-quarto-figure .crunch-figcaption .crunch-images .crunch-math .crunch-ul}

::: {layout="[2,1]" layout-valign="center"}

::: {#rights-text}

* Rights are **vetoes** which **individuals** can use to cancel out **collective**/institutional decisions which affect them (key example for us: right to **privacy**)
* Rawls/liberalism: individual rights are **lexically prior to** "efficiency" and/or distributional concerns
* Why the buzzword "lexically"? Enter (non-scary) math!
* We can put *lowercase* letters of English alphabet in an **order**: $\texttt{a} \prec \texttt{b} \prec \cdots \texttt{z}$
* We can put *capital* letters of English alphabet in an order: $\texttt{A} \prec \texttt{B} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{Z}$
* What if we need to sort stuff with **both** types? We can decide that capital letters are **lexically prior** to lowercase letters, giving us a combined ordering:

:::

![@dworkin_taking_1977](images/dworkin.jpg){fig-align="center" width="300"}

:::

$$
\boxed{\texttt{A} \prec \texttt{B} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{Z} \prec \texttt{a} \prec \texttt{b} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{z}}
$$

## Lexical Ordering (I Tricked You 😈)

::: {layout="[2,1]"}
::: {#trick-left}

* You thought I was just talking about *letters*, but they're actually **variables**: capital letters are rights, lowercase letters are distributive principles

$$
\underbrace{\texttt{A} \prec \texttt{B} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{Z}}_{\mathclap{\substack{\text{Individual Rights} \\ \text{Basic Goods}}}} \phantom{\prec} \prec \phantom{\prec} \underbrace{\texttt{a} \prec \texttt{b} \prec \cdots \prec \texttt{z}}_{\mathclap{\substack{\text{Distributive Principles} \\ \text{Money and whatnot}}}}

## Better Metaphor Than Letters {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-math .crunch-quarto-figure}

* Letters are where Rawls gets "lexically prior" from, but letters are **total orderings** (we know where *every* letter "stands" in relation to *every* other letter)
* Better metaphor: a **high school** with a hierarchy such that

$$
\text{Seniors} \prec \text{Juniors} \prec \text{Sophomores}  \prec \text{Freshmen} 
$$

* $\implies$ If you're a Freshman, whether at the "top" or "bottom" of a ranking of Freshmen, you're still **prior to** all Sophomores...
* Why is this more helpful? Because **we don't need to define** the **rankings *within* classes** to know the **rankings *between* classes** in this case

* Deontological **rule**: *"Don't lie"*
  * But then: Nazis come to your house, ask you if you're harboring any Jews
* k, new deontological **rule**: *"Don't lie unless necessary"*
  * Who decides when it's necessary?
* Deontological commitment: *Pacifism / Nonviolence*
  * But then: someone swingin on you
* k, new deontological **commitment**: *Pacifism / Nonviolence Except In Self-Defense*
  * Who decides what counts as self-defense?

## Individual vs. Social Morality {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-figcaption .crunch-images .crunch-quarto-figure}

* That was all already hard enough, to reason about **individual** morality
* Now add in the fact that we live in a society 😰
* Things that happen depend not only on **our** choices but also the choices of others

## Enter Game Theory {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-figcaption .crunch-ul}

* A tool for analyzing how **individual choices** + **choices of others** $\rightarrow$ **outcomes**!

::: {layout="[1,1]" layout-valign="center"}

::: {#game-theory-text}

* Example: You ($A$) and a friend ($B$) committed a robbery, and you're brought into the police station for questioning.
* You're placed in separate rooms, and each of you is offered a **plea deal**: if you **testify** while your partner **stays silent**, you go free and they go to jail for 3 years.
* Otherwise, if you **both stay silent**, they have very little evidence and can only jail you for **1 year**
* However, there's a catch: if you **both confess**, you both get **two years** in jail, since they now have maximal evidence

## Individual Decision-Making {.smaller .title-11}

::: {layout="[1,1]" layout-valign="center"}

::: {#step-by-step}

* Let's think through $A$'s **best responses** to the possible choices $B$ could make:
* If $B$ **stays silent**, what is $A$'s best option?
  * **Staying silent** results in **1 year** of jail
  * **Testifying** results in **0 years** of jail
  * So it is **better to testify**
* If $B$ **testifies**, what is $A$'s best option?
  * **Staying silent** results in **3 years** of jail
  * **Testifying** results in **2 years** of jail
  * So it is **better to testify**
* The result: **regardless of what $B$ does**, $A$ is **better off testifying**!

## The Social Outcome {.crunch-title .crunch-ul}

::: {layout="[1,1]" layout-valign="center"}

::: {#social-outcome-text}

* The game is **symmetric**, so the same logic applies for $B$
* Conclusion: **the outcome of the game will be $s^* = (\text{Testify}, \text{Testify})$**
* This is called a **Nash equilibrium**: no player $i$ can make themselves better off by **deviating** from $s_i$

# Nuts and Bolts for Fairness {data-stack-name="Fairness"}

## One Final Reminder {.crunch-title}

* Industry rule #4080: Cannot "prove" $q(x) = \text{``Algorithm }x\text{ is fair''}$! Only $p(x) \implies q(y)$:

$$
\underbrace{p(x)}_{\substack{\text{Accept ethical} \\ \text{framework }x}} \implies \underbrace{q(y)}_{\substack{\text{Algorithms should} \\ \text{satisfy condition }y}}
$$

* Before: **possible ethical frameworks** (values for $x$)
* Now: **possible fairness criteria** (values for $y$)

## We Can Do (A Bit) Better... {.smaller}

* Use **random variables** to model inferences made by an algorithm (or a human!)
* $\implies$ fairness by statistically **equalizing** loan rejections, error rate, etc. between groups
* Obvious **societal** drawback: **equality** does not ameliorate the effects of **past injustices** (see: police contact vs. trust-in-government plot from last week)
  * This one we saw coming, given "context-free" nature!
* Less obvious **mathematical** drawback: **impossibility results** (because algebra 😳)
  * Roughly: can't satisfy [more than] two statistical fairness criteria at once; similar to how setting $\Pr(X) = p$ also determines $\Pr(\text{not }X) = 1 - p$, or how plugging $x = 3$ into $x + y = 5$ leaves only one possibility $y = 2$
* **BUT**, "impossibility" $\neq$ impossibility: (a) one criteria may be "all you need" in given setting; (b) can derive **more robust** measures by "relaxing" confusion-matrix measures

## What the Fairness Measures Will Feel Like For Now {.smaller .crunch-title .title-10}

![](images/rock_on_rich_brian.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Who Remembers... 🎉*Confusion Matrices!!!*🎉 {.smaller .crunch-title .title-11}

* Now $D = 1$ could literally mean *"shoot this person"* or *"throw this person in jail for life"*

![From @mitchell_algorithmic_2021](images/mitchell_et_al.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Our First Fairness Measure (Finally)! {.crunch-title .smaller .crunch-ul .crunch-math}

* Standard across the literature: Random Variable $A_i$ "encoding" membership in protected/sensitive group. In HW1, for example:

$$
A_i = \begin{cases}
0 &\text{if }i\text{ self-reported ``white''} \\
1 &\text{if }i\text{ self-reported ``black''}
\end{cases}
$$

* **Notice**: choice of mapping into $\{0, 1\}$ here **non-arbitrary**!
* We want our models/criteria to be **descriptively** but also **normatively robust**; e.g.:
* **If** (antecedent I hold, though <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/08/12/deep-divisions-in-americans-views-of-nations-racial-history-and-how-to-address-it/' target='_blank'>majority in US</a> do not) one believes that ending (much less repairing) centuries of unrelenting white supremacist violence here might require asymmetric race-based policies,
* **Then** our model should allow different **normative labels** and differential **weights** on

  $$
  \begin{align*}
  \Delta &= (\text{Fairness} \mid A = 1) - (\text{Fairness} \mid A = 0) \\
  \nabla &= (\text{Fairness} \mid A = 0) - (\text{Fairness} \mid A = 1)
  \end{align*}
  $$

  despite the **descriptive** fact that $\Delta = -\nabla$.

## Where Descriptive and Normative Become Intertwined {.crunch-title .title-07}

* Allowing this **asymmetry** is precisely what enables bring **descriptive** facts to bear on **normative** concerns!
* **Mathematically** we can always "flip" the mapping from racial labels into $\{0, 1\}$...
* But this (in a precise, mathematical sense: namely, *isomorphism*) implies that we're treating **racial categorization** as the same type of phenomenon as **driving on left or right side of road** (see: prev slides on why we make the descriptive vs. normative distinction)
* (See also: Sweden's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_H' target='_blank'>Dagen H</a>!)

## "Fairness" Through Equalized *Positive* Rates {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .title-08 .math-90}

$$
\Pr(D = 1 \mid A = 0) = \Pr(D = 1 \mid A = 1)
$$

* This works specifically for discrete, **binary**-valued categories
* For general attributes (whether discrete or continuous!), generalizes to:

$$
D \perp A \iff \Pr(D = d, A = a) = \Pr(D = d)\Pr(A = a)
$$

## "Fairness" Through Equalized *Error* Rates {.smaller .crunch-title .title-12}

* Equalized **False Positive Rate**:

$$
\Pr(D = 1 \mid Y = 0, A = 0) = \Pr(D = 1 \mid Y = 0, A = 1)
$$

* Equalized **False Negative Rate**:

$$
\Pr(D = 0 \mid Y = 1, A = 0) = \Pr(D = 0 \mid Y = 1, A = 1)
$$

* For general (non-binary) attributes: $(D \perp A) \mid Y$:

$$
\Pr(D = d, A = a \mid Y = y) = \Pr(D = d \mid Y = y)\Pr(A = a \mid Y = y)
$$

## NO MORE EQUATIONS! 😤 {.smaller}

* Depending on your background and/or learning style (say, visual vs. auditory), you may be able to look at equations on previous slides and "see" what they're "saying"
* If your brain works similarly to **mine**, however, your eyes glazed over, you began dissociating, planning an escape route, looking for open ventilation ducts, etc.
* If you're in the latter group, welcome to the **cult of Probabilistic Graphical Models** 😈

## Baby Steps: A Real-World Confusion Matrix {.title-11 .crunch-title .smaller}

| | Labeled Low-Risk | Labeled High-Risk |
| - | - | - |
| **Didn't Do More Crimes** | *True Negative* | *False Positive* |
**Did More Crimes** | *False Negative* | *True Positive* |

: {tbl-colwidths="[30,40,40]"}

* What kinds of **causal connections** and/or **feedback loops** might there be between our **decision variable** (low vs. high risk) and our **outcome variable** (did vs. didn't do more crimes)
* What types of **policy implications** might this process have, after it "runs" for several "iterations"?
* Why might some segments of society, with some shared ethical framework(s), **weigh** the **"costs"** of false negatives and false positives **differently** from other segments of society with different shared ethical framework(s)?

    w_i = \frac{\Pr(Y_i = 1)}{\Pr(Y_i = 1 \mid A_i = 1)}
    $$

    and use derived dataset $\widetilde{X}_i$ to learn $r(X)$ (via ML algorithm)... Why does this work?
* Let $\mathcal{X}_{\text{fair}}$ be the set of all possible **reweighted versions** of $X_i$ ensuring $Y_i \perp A_i$. Then

$$
\widetilde{X}_i = \min_{X_i' \in \mathcal{X}_{\text{fair}}}\textsf{distance}(X_i', X_i) = \min_{X_i' \in \mathcal{X}_{\text{fair}}}\underbrace{KL(X_i' \| X_i)}_{\text{Relative entropy!}}
$$

* The bad news: nobody in the fairness in AI community read @dedeo_wrong_2016, which proves this using information theory? Idk. It has a total of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/scholar?lookup=0&q=wrong+side+of+the+tracks+dedeo&hl=en&as_sdt=0,9' target='_blank'>22 citations</a> 😐

## "Fairness" Through Equalized *Error* Rates {.smaller .crunch-title .title-12 .crunch-math}

* Equalized **positive** rates didn't take **outcomes** $Y_i$ into account...
  * (Even if $A_i = 1 \Rightarrow Y_i = 1, A_i = 0 \Rightarrow Y_i = 0$, we'd have to choose $\widehat{Y}_i = c$)
* This time, we consider the **outcome** $Y$ that 

* Equalized **False Positive Rate** (**EFPR**):

$$
\Pr(D = 1 \mid Y = 0, A = 0) = \Pr(D = 1 \mid Y = 0, A = 1)
$$

* Equalized **False Negative Rate** (**EFNR**):

$$
\Pr(D = 0 \mid Y = 1, A = 0) = \Pr(D = 0 \mid Y = 1, A = 1)
$$

* For general (non-binary) attributes: $(D \perp A) \mid Y$:

$$
\Pr(D = d, A = a \mid Y = y) = \Pr(D = d \mid Y = y)\Pr(A = a \mid Y = y)
$$

## ⚠️ LESS EQUATIONS PLEASE! 😤 {.smaller}

* Depending on your background and/or learning style (say, visual vs. auditory), you may be able to look at equations on previous two slides and "see" what they're "saying"
* If your brain works similarly to **mine**, however, your eyes glazed over, you began dissociating, planning an escape route, etc., the moment $> 2$ variables appeared
* If you're in the latter group, welcome to the **cult of Probabilistic Graphical Models** 😈

## Back to Equalized Error Rates {.crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio' target='_blank'>**Blackstone's Ratio**</a>: *"It is better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffers."* [@blackstone_commentaries_1769]
* Mathematically $\Rightarrow \text{Cost}(FPR) = 10\cdot \text{Cost}(FNR)$
* Legally $\Rightarrow$ *beyond reasonable doubt* standard for conviction
* EFPR $\iff$ rates of false conviction should be the same for everyone, including members of different racial groups.
  * Violated when black people are disproportionately likely to be incorrectly convicted, as if a **lower evidentiary standard** were applied to black people.

## One Final Context-Free Criterion: Calibration

* A risk function $r(X)$ is **calibrated** if

$$
\Pr(Y = 1 \mid r(X) = v_r) = v_r
$$

* (Sweeping a lot of details under the rug), I see this one as: **the risk function "tracks" real-world probabilities**
* Then, $r(X)$ is **calibrated by group** if

$$
\Pr(Y = y \mid r(X) = v_r, A = a) = v_r
$$

<!-- ## Minimizing Loss Function Penalizing (Only) These Errors $\iff$ Single-Threshold Fairness {.smaller .crunch-title .title-09}

* Loss function: $\ell(d, \widehat{d})$
* An **optimal classifier** minimizes the expected loss: $\mathbb{E}[\ell(\widehat{d},d)]$
* A **decision** is considered to be fair if individuals with the same score $s_i = \psi(v_i)$ are treated equally, regardless of group membership (Corbett-Davies & Goel 2018). -->

## Impossibility Results

* tldr: We cannot possibly achieve all three of **equalized positive rates** (often also termed "anti-classification"), classification **parity**, and **calibration** (regardless of **base rates**)
* More alarmingly: We can't even achieve both classification **parity** and **calibration**, except in the special case of **equal base rates**

## "Impossibility" vs. Impossibility {.smaller .crunch-title}

* Sometimes "impossibility results" are, for all intents and purposes, mathematical curiosities: often there's some **pragmatic** way of getting around them
* Example: "Arrow's Impossibility Theorem"
  * [In theory] It is mathematically impossible to **aggregate individual preferences** into **societal preferences**
  * [The catch] True only if people are restricted to **ordinal preferences**: "I prefer $x$ to $y$." No more information allowed
  * [The way around it] Allow people to indicate the **magnitude** of their preferences: "I prefer $x$ 5 times more than $y$"
* In this case, though, there are direct and (often) unavoidable real-world barriers that fairness impossibility imposes 😕

## Arrow's Impossibility Theorem {.crunch-title .smaller .crunch-ul}

* Aziza, Bogdan, and Charles are competing in a **fitness test** with four events. Goal: determine who is **most fit overall**

| | Run | Jump | Hurdle | Weights |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Aziza | 10.1" | 6.0' | 40" | 150 lb |
| Bogdan | 9.2" | 5.9' | 42" | 140 lb |
| Charles | 10.0" | 6.1' | 39" | 145 lb |

* We **can** rank unambiguously on **individual events**: **Jump**: Charles $\succ_J$ Aziza $\succ_J$ Bogdan
* Now, **axioms** for aggregation:
  * $\text{WP}$ (Weak Pareto Optimality): if $x \succ_i y$ for all events $i$, $x \succ y$
  * $\text{IIA}$ (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives): If a fourth competitor enters, but Aziza and Bogdan still have the same relative standing on all events, their relative standing overall should not change
* Long story short: only aggregation that can satisfy these is "dictatorship": choose one event, give it importance of 100%, the rest have importance 0% 😰

## ProPublica vs. Northpointe {.smaller .crunch-title}

* This is... an example with 1000s of books and papers and discussions around it! (A red flag 🚩, since, obsession with one example may conceal much wider range of issues!)
* But, tldr, Northpointe created a ML algorithm called COMPAS, used by court systems all over the US to predict "risk" of arrestees
* In 2016, ProPublica published results from an investigative report documenting COMPAS's racial discrimination, in the form of violating **equal error rates** between black and white arrestees
* Northpointe responded that COMPAS does **not** discriminate, as it satisfies **calibration**
* People have argued about who is "right" for 8 years, with some progress, but... not a lot

## So... What Do We Do? {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote}

* One option: argue about which of the two definitions is "better" for the next 100 years (what is the best way to give food to the poor?)

> It appears to reveal an unfortunate but inexorable fact about our world: we must choose between two intuitively appealing ways to understand fairness in ML. Many scholars have done just that, defending either ProPublica's or Northpointe’s definitions against what they see as the misguided alternative. [@simons_algorithms_2023]

* Another option: study and then work to ameliorate the social conditions which **force us into** this realm of mathematical impossibility (why do the poor have no food?)

> The impossibility result is about much more than math. [It occurs because] the underlying outcome is distributed unevenly in society. This is a fact about society, not mathematics, and requires engaging with a complex, checkered history of systemic racism in the US. Predicting an outcome whose distribution is shaped by this history requires tradeoffs because the inequalities and injustices are encoded in data---in this case, because America has criminalized Blackness for as long as America has existed.

## Why Not Both?? {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* On the one hand: yes, both! On the other hand: <a hrf='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation' target='_blank'>fallacy of the "middle ground"</a>
* We're back at **descriptive vs. normative**:
  * **Descriptively**, given 100 values $v_1, \ldots, v_{100}$, their **mean** may be a good way to summarize, if we have to choose a single number
  * But, **normatively**, imagine that these are **opinions** that people hold about fairness.
  * Now, if it's the US South in 1860 and $v_i$ represents person $i$'s approval of slavery, from a sample of 100 people, then approx. 97 of the $v_i$'s are "does not disapprove" [@rousey_friends_2001] --- in this case, normatively, is the mean $0.97$ the "correct" answer?
* We have another case where, like the "grass is green" vs. "grass ought to be green" example, we cannot just "import" our logical/mathematical tools from the former to solve the latter! (However: this does **not** mean they are **useless**! This is the fallacy of the **excluded middle**, sort of the opposite of the fallacy of the middle ground)
* This is why we have **ethical frameworks** in the first place! Going back to **Rawls**: "97% of Americans think black people shouldn't have rights" &nbsp;$\nimplies$"black people shouldn't have rights", since rights are a **primary good**

## Easy Mode: Descriptive Judgements {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-p .title-12}

**How did you acquire the concept "red"?**

* People pointed to stuff with certain properties and said "red" (or "rojo" or "红"), as pieces of an **intersubjective** communication system
* These **descriptive** labels enable *coordination*, like driving on left or right side of road!
* Nothing very profound or difficult in **committing** to this descriptive coordination: *"for **ease of communication**, I'll vibrate my vocal chords like this (or write these symbols) to indicate $x$, and vibrate them like this (or write these other symbols) to indicate $y$"*
<!-- * Technically you have the free will to **refuse** this prescription. But, nothing very "" -->
* Linguistic choices, when it comes to **description**, are arbitrary*: Our mouths can make [these sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), and each language is a mapping: [combinations of sounds] $\leftrightarrow$ [things]

## What Makes Ethical Judgements "More Difficult"? {.smaller .title-11 .crunch-title .crunch-p}

**How did you acquire the concept "good"?**

* People pointed to **actions** with certain properties and said "good" (and pointed at others and said "bad"), as part of instilling **values** in you
* "Grass is green" just links two **descriptive** referents together, while "Honesty is good" takes the **descriptive** concept "honesty" and *links it* with the **normative** concept "good"
* In doing this, parents/teachers/friends are doing way more than just linking sounds and things in the world (**de**scribing): they are also **prescribing** rules of moral conduct!
* **Normative** concepts go beyond "mere" communication: course of your life / future / [things that matter deeply to people] differ if you **act on** one set of norms vs. another
* $\implies$ Ethics centrally involves non-arbitrarily-chosen **commitments**!
