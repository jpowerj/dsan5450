## Impossibility Results

* tldr: We cannot possibly achieve all three of **equalized positive rates** (often also termed "anti-classification"), classification **parity**, and **calibration** (regardless of **base rates**)
* More alarmingly: We can't even achieve both classification **parity** and **calibration**, except in the special case of **equal base rates**

## "Impossibility" vs. Impossibility {.smaller .crunch-title}

* Sometimes "impossibility results" are, for all intents and purposes, mathematical curiosities: often there's some **pragmatic** way of getting around them
* Example: "Arrow's Impossibility Theorem"
  * [In theory] It is mathematically impossible to **aggregate individual preferences** into **societal preferences**
  * [The catch] True only if people are restricted to **ordinal preferences**: "I prefer $x$ to $y$." No more information allowed
  * [The way around it] Allow people to indicate the **magnitude** of their preferences: "I prefer $x$ 5 times more than $y$"
* In this case, though, there are direct and (often) unavoidable real-world barriers that fairness impossibility imposes ðŸ˜•

## Arrow's Impossibility Theorem {.crunch-title .smaller .crunch-ul}

* Aziza, Bogdan, and Charles are competing in a **fitness test** with four events. Goal: determine who is **most fit overall**

| | Run | Jump | Hurdle | Weights |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Aziza | 10.1" | 6.0' | 40" | 150 lb |
| Bogdan | 9.2" | 5.9' | 42" | 140 lb |
| Charles | 10.0" | 6.1' | 39" | 145 lb |

* We **can** rank unambiguously on **individual events**: **Jump**: Charles $\succ_J$ Aziza $\succ_J$ Bogdan
* Now, **axioms** for aggregation:
  * $\text{WP}$ (Weak Pareto Optimality): if $x \succ_i y$ for all events $i$, $x \succ y$
  * $\text{IIA}$ (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives): If a fourth competitor enters, but Aziza and Bogdan still have the same relative standing on all events, their relative standing overall should not change
* Long story short: only aggregation that can satisfy these is "dictatorship": choose one event, give it importance of 100%, the rest have importance 0% ðŸ˜°
