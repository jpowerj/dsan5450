# <i class='bi bi-1-circle'></i> Context-Free <br>[$\rightarrow$ <i class='bi bi-2-circle'></i> Context-Sensitive]{.cbg-darker} {.title-12 data-stack-name="Context-Free Fairness"}

## First: Imm[a]{.boxed-crunch}nent Critique {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .text-90}

* "Trancendental" Critique: Your assumptions are stupid! You should use these ones instead (then we get the result I want 😈)
* Immanent ($\neq$ Imm[i]{.boxed-crunch}nent) Critique: Let's work **within** your set of assumptions, and **derive** something undesirable
* *$\neq$ Proof by Contradiction! More "Proof by Pragmatism"*
* *Think of **geometry**: for modeling 2D table, "effective" derivation of results from Euclid's 5th; for modeling 4D space-time, "effective" derivation of results from Riemannian geometry*

## Our Case: For Reflective Equilibrium! {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .text-75 .inline-80 .crunch-quarto-figure}

![Steamboat William (1803), Colorized](images/surprise_tool_crop.jpg){fig-align="center"}

* <i class='bi bi-1-circle'></i> Assume brogrammer Fairness&trade; Definitions
* <i class='bi bi-2-circle'></i> See what results we get
* <i class='bi bi-3-circle'></i> Do they seem 👍/👎 intuitively? And/or on feasibly-intersubjective criteria?
* *(Secretly you already did this with **fairness through unawareness** / **anti-classification**: dropping race $\overset{?}{=}$ no racism?)*

## ProPublica vs. Northpointe {.text-85 .crunch-title}

* Example with 1000s of books, papers, discussions around it! 
  * *🚩: obsession with one example may conceal wider range of issues*
* Northpointe created a ML algorithm called COMPAS, used by court systems all over the US to predict "risk" of arrestees
* In 2016, ProPublica published investigative report documenting COMPAS's racial discrimination, in violating **equal error rates** between black and white arrestees
* Northpointe responded that COMPAS does **not** discriminate, as it satisfies **calibration**
* People have argued about who is "right" for 8 years, with some progress, but... not a lot

## COMPAS Overview {.text-90 .crunch-title}

> When defendants are booked into jail in Broward County, Florida, they are asked to respond to a **COMPAS questionnaire** with 137 questions, including "Was one of your **parents** ever sent to jail or prison?," "How many of your friends/acquaintances are taking drugs illegally?," and "How often did you get into fights at school?" Arrestees are also asked to agree or disagree with the statements **"A hungry person has the right to steal"** and "If people make me angry or I lose my temper, I can be dangerous."
> 
> Answers are fed into the COMPAS model, which generates an individual risk score **reported in three buckets: "low risk" (1 to 4), "medium risk" (5 to 7), and "high risk" (8 to 10)**.

## COMPAS Overview {.text-90 .crunch-title}

> ProPublica accused COMPAS of racism: *"There's
software used across the country to predict future
criminals. And it's biased against blacks,"* read the
subheading on the article.
> 
> ProPublica found that COMPAS's error rates---the rate at which the model got it wrong---were unequal across racial groups. COMPAS's predictions were more likely to incorrectly label African Americans as high risk and more likely to incorrectly label white Americans as low risk.
> 
> *"In the criminal justice context,"* said Julia Angwin, coauthor of the ProPublica article, *"false findings can have far-reaching effects on the lives of the people charged with crimes."*
