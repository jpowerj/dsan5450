Use the **tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet** (e.g., click the label **HW1**) to view the point distributions for different assignments.

The distributions are imported from a Google Sheet mainly for transparency: so that you can see exactly how totals are computed as a sum of the individual points allocated for each test!
