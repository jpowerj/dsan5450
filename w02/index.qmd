# Weeks 2-4: Slouching Towards Fairness {.smaller .not-title-slide .title-09 data-stack-name="Ethical Arguments"}

* Soon you'll understand why I kept maniacally pointing to $p \Rightarrow q$ on board last week!
* "Rules" for fairness are not "rules" at all! They're statements of the form **"If we accept ethical framework $x$, then our algorithms ought to satisfy condition $y$"**

$$
\underbrace{p(x)}_{\substack{\text{Accept ethical} \\ \text{framework }x}} \implies \underbrace{q(y)}_{\substack{\text{Algorithms should} \\ \text{satisfy condition }y}}
$$

* <i class='bi bi-1-circle'></i> Very broad intro to **possible ethical frameworks** (values for $x$)
* <i class='bi bi-2-circle'></i> Very broad intro to **possible fairness criteria** (values for $y$)
* $\leadsto$ **HW1: Nuts and Bolts for Evaluating Fairness**


## Recap: Ethical Systems and Promise-Keeping {.text-65 .callout-fix .crunch-title .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-quarto-figure .crunch-ul .title-11 .crunch-li-8 .crunch-img .crunch-callout-12}

::::: {.callout-tip title="Our First Ethical Dilemma 🥳"}

:::: {layout="[85,15]" layout-valign="center"}
::: {#pie-left}

* Scenario: You just baked a pie, and you **promised** your friend you'd give them the pie. You walk to friend's house to give them the pie.
* Suddenly, you encounter a **hostage-taker** who will **kill their hostage** unless someone **gives them a pie** within 1min. Do you give your pie?

::::
:::::

::: {layout="[43,57]"}
::: {#conseqentialism}

<center>
**Consequentialist Ethics $\implies$ Yes**
</center>

* To be ethical is to weigh **expected consequences** of your actions
* **Positive consequences** of giving pie (saving a life) outweigh **negative consequences** (breaking promise)
* Ex: **Utilitarianism** (Jeremy Bentham)
* [*(Complication: [Rule Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_utilitarianism) = choose rule that produces greatest good 😵‍💫)*]{style="font-size: 80%;"}

:::
::: {#deontology}

<center>
**Deontological Ethics $\implies$ No**
</center>

* To be ethical is to live by **rules** which you would **want everyone to follow**, even if you following them **doesn't lead to others following them** (**non**-consequentialist!)
* As a **rule** (a "categorical imperative"), you **must not break promises**. (Breaking $\Rightarrow$ others can also "pick and choose" when to honor promises to you)
* Ex: **Kantian Ethics** (Immanuel Kant)

## Making and Evaluating Ethical Arguments

* The gist: A doctor who **diagnoses** cancer in a patient does not thereby **morally endorse** the presence of the cancer in the patient...

## The *Is-Ought Distinction* {.crunch-title .aside-65}

::: {.callout-note title="Hume on *Is* vs. *Ought* [@hume_treatise_1739]" icon="false"}

* *The author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning...*
* *suddenly, instead of the usual propositions **is** and **is not**,*
* *we encounter an **ought**, or an **ought not**.*
* *This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence.*

## Is This Just Jeff Yapping About Unions? {.title-08 .crunch-title .text-90}

* Invert union model for model of **Data Externalities**:
* **Health insurance company** $C$ uses ML to predict rare disease $Y \in \{0, 1\}$ from [public] individual characteristics $X$
* You have rare disease ($Y_i = 1$), but $C$ doesn't know bc of data privacy laws (person must consent to share their data)
* Company offers small reward to others $j$ for sharing $Y_j$
* $\leadsto$ even if **you** withhold $Y_i$, others sharing $Y_j$ $\Rightarrow$ $C$ gets better and better at predicting $\widehat{Y}_i = f(X_i)$
* $\leadsto$ $C$ predicts $\widehat{Y}_i = 1$, refuses to insure you

<!-- * [Axiom] *Differential Privacy* (HW2) ensures no data leaks -->

## Takeaway for Policy Whitepapers {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-quarto-figure .crunch-img}

::: {layout="[1,1]" layout-valign="center"}

::: {#takeaway-text}

* You *cannot* (just) say, "doing $x$ will be better for society"
* You must *also* justify benefits to individuals, or at minimum, the individual organization and its stakeholders!
* *(Is this a normative or descriptive claim?)*

* Apples-to-applies comparison via **Statistical Matching**:
* @lyall_divided_2020: "Treating certain ethnic groups as second-class citizens [...] leads victimized soldiers to subvert military authorities once war begins. The higher an army's inequality, the greater its rates of desertion, side-switching, and casualties"

> Matching constructs **pairs of belligerents** that are **similar** across a wide range of traits thought to dictate battlefield performance but that **vary** in levels of prewar inequality. The more similar the belligerents, the better our estimate of inequality's effects, as all other traits are shared and thus cannot explain observed differences in performance, helping assess how battlefield performance **would have** improved (declined) if the belligerent had a lower (higher) level of prewar inequality.
> 
> Since [non-matched] cases are **dropped** [...] selected cases are more representative of average belligerents/wars than outliers with few or no matches, [providing] surer ground for testing generalizability of the book's claims than focusing solely on canonical but unrepresentative usual suspects (Germany, the United States, Israel)

# Machine Learning at 30,000 Feet {data-stack-name="Fair ML"}

## Three Component Parts of Machine Learning

1. A cool algorithm 😎😍
2. [Possibly benign but possibly biased] Training data ❓🧐
3. Exploitation of below-minimum-wage human labor 😞🤐 [@dube_monopsony_2020, like and subscribe yall ❤️]

## A Cool Algorithm 😎😍 {.smaller .crunch-title}

## Training Data With *Acknowledged* Bias {.smaller .crunch-title .title-11 .crunch-quarto-layout-panel .crunch-quarto-figure}

* One potentially fruitful approach to fairness: since we can't *eliminate* it, bring it out into the open and study it! 
* This can, at very least, help us brainstorm how we might "correct" for it (next slides!)

  * $\overrightarrow{\texttt{she}}$ mapped to $\langle -1,0\rangle$, $\overrightarrow{\texttt{he}}$ mapped to $\langle 1,0 \rangle$, others **projected** onto this dimension

## Context-Free Fairness {.smaller .title-12 .crunch-title}

* Who Remembers **🎉*Confusion Matrices!!!*🎉**

## Categories of Fairness Criteria {.smaller .crunch-title}

```{=html}
<style>
#fairness-box .columns {
  display: flex !important;
  height: 100% !important;
}

#fairness-box .column {
  /* border: 2px solid black !important; */
  padding: 14px !important;
  box-sizing: border-box !important;
  /* height: 100% !important; */
}
</style>
```

Roughly, approaches to fairness/bias in AI can be categorized as follows:

<div id="fairness-box" style="border: 2px solid black !important; box-sizing: border-box !important;">

<center>
**Fairness**
</center>

<!-- start columns -->
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="46%"}

<div style="border: 2px solid black !important; height: 100% !important;">
<center>
**Context-Free**
</center>

* Single-Threshold Fairness
* Equal Prediction
* Equal Decision

</div>

:::
::: {.column width="8%"}

<center>
<span style="font-size: 180% !important;"><i class='bi bi-repeat'></i>
</center>

::: {.column width="46%"}

<div style="border: 2px solid black !important; height: 100% !important;">
<center style="margin: 0px !important;">
**Context-Sensitive**
</center>

* Fairness via Similarity Metric(s)
* Causal Definitions

</div>

* [Week 3] **Context-Free** Fairness: Easier to grasp from CS/data science perspective; rooted in "language" of ML (you already know much of it, given DSAN 5000!)
* But **easy-to-grasp notion** $\neq$ **"good" notion**!
* Your job: push yourself to (a) consider what is getting **left out of** the context-free definitions, and (b) the **loopholes** that are thus introduced into them, whereby people/computers can discriminate while remaining "technically fair"

## Laws: Often Perfectly "Technically Fair" (Context-Free Fairness) {.title-09}

> *Ah, la majestueuse égalité des lois, qui interdit au riche comme au pauvre de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain!*

> In the long evenings in West Beirut, there was time enough to consider where the core of the tragedy lay. In the age of Assyrians, the Empire of Rome, in the 1860s perhaps? In the French Mandate? In Auschwitz? In Palestine? In the rusting front-door keys now buried deep in the rubble of Shatila? In the 1978 Israeli invasion? In the 1982 invasion? Was there a point where one could have said: Stop, beyond this point there is no future? Did I witness the point of no return in 1976? That 12-year-old on the broken office chair in the ruins of the Beirut front line? Now he was, in his mid-twenties (if he was still alive), a gunboy no more. A gunman, no doubt... [@fisk_pity_1990]
