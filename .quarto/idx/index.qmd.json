Students will explore and critically evaluate a range of data-related issues in contemporary society, such as responsible data collection, algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, democratic participation in data usage and data-driven decisions, and the ethical implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (self-driving cars, ChatGPT, crowd-sourced training data, etc.).\n\nBeginning with a set of historical case studies—instances in which scientists, engineers, and policymakers have been forced to re-evaluate their ethical intuitions in light of technological developments (nuclear power, use of social media platforms to organize protests and influence political outcomes, deployment of facial recognition software and predictive AI by police and military forces)—the course then introduces a set of general ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics), challenging students to consider their relative strengths and weaknesses for addressing modern technological-ethical dilemmas faced by businesses, healthcare organizations, governments, and academic institutions. After a final portion of the course linking these ethical frameworks with practical regulatory and policy considerations, students will write and present a policy whitepaper analyzing a data-ethical issue of particular interest to them, integrating ethical perspectives, regulatory principles, and domain knowledge into a recommendation of best practices for the relevant agency, firm, or institution.\n\nThe course will thus equip students with a robust ethical \"toolbox\" for conscientiously gathering, interpreting, and extracting meaning from data throughout their careers as data scientists, while respecting privacy, fairness, transparency, democratic accountability, and other social concerns. *Prerequisites: None. 3 credits*.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nWelcome to the homepage for ***DSAN 5450: Data Ethics and Policy*** at Georgetown University, for the Spring 2024 semester!\n\nThe course meets on **Wednesdays from 3:30pm to 6:00pm** in the **<a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/fVVfDFpp4MEuukXa9' target='_blank'>Walsh Building<i class='bi bi-box-arrow-up-right ps-1'></i></a>**, **Room 498**.\n\nCheck out the [**syllabus**](syllabus.qmd) (or any other link in the sidebar) for more info!
