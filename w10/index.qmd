# Policy Evaluation in General {data-stack-name="The Master's Tools"}

## Why Call It "Econometric" Policy Evaluation? {.crunch-title .title-08 .crunch-ul}

* In the same way that data science can be used for good or for not-so-good...
* Economics provides methods that allow us to **evaluate** a policy with respect to an **ethical framework**
* Typically **efficiency** and/or **profit maximization**, but just as easily **Rawlsian** or **Roemerian**
* "The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house"❓❓❓
* ("It's certainly true that the master uses the tool of [data science], but that doesn't mean he owns it.")

## Lily Hu {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-quarto-layout-panel}

* CS excludes ethical considerations "by design", via focus on how computers **do** work, not how they **ought to work**.
* The latter "falls within the purview of the normative disciplines, most notably ethics, a subfield of philosophy. For students to succeed at learning not only how to build innovative computing systems, but also how to determine whether they should build those systems or how ethical considerations should constrain their design, it is imperative that these two disciplines work together. To this end, Harvard CS and Philosophy faculty have been partnering to develop the Embedded EthiCS curriculum."

# Social Welfare Functionals {data-stack-name="Social Welfare Functionals"}

## Functionals?

* You probably know what a **function** $f(x)$ is; a **functional** is a function of functions: $\mathscr{G}(f)$
* It's from math, which is scary, but it's just notation to remind us that we're analyzing **functions of functions**
* In our case, they "work the same way" as regular functions, e.g., $\mathscr{G}(f,g) = f^2 + g^2$, so $f(x) = x, g(x) = 2x \Rightarrow \mathscr{G}(f,g)(x) = x^2 + 4x^2 = 5x^2$

## We Live In A Society, Part 2 {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-math .crunch-p .crunch-ul-top .inline-95 .math-95}

* Utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and Rawls can all be modeled as **Social Welfare Functionals**

$$
W(\mathbf{u}) = W(u_1, \ldots, u_n) \Rightarrow W(\mathbf{u})(x) = W(u_1(x), \ldots, u_n(x))
$$

* $u_i(x)$: Given bundle of resources $x$, how much utility does $i$ experience? $u_i: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
* $W(\mathbf{u})$: **Aggregates** $u_i(x)$ over all $i$, to produce measure of **overall welfare of society**. $W: (\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R})^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
* $W(\mathbf{u}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_iu_i(x)$. $\omega_i$ is $i$'s **welfare weight**
* (Preview) Decomposition: evaluate **policies** by estimating **marginal utility** $u'_i(x)$ compared to $\omega_i$)

## Alternative SWF Specifications {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .smaller}

* Social values

$$
W(\underbrace{v_1, \ldots, v_n}_{\text{Values}})(x) \overset{\text{e.g.}}{=} \omega_1\underbrace{v_1(x)}_{\text{Privacy}} + \omega_2\underbrace{v_2(x)}_{\mathclap{\text{Public Health}}}
$$

* Stakeholder Analysis

$$
W(\underbrace{s_1, \ldots, s_n}_{\text{Stakeholders}})(x) = \omega_1\underbrace{u_{s_1}(x)}_{\text{Teachers}} + \omega_2\underbrace{u_{s_2}(x)}_{\text{Parents}} + \omega_3\underbrace{u_{s_3}(x)}_{\text{Students}} + \omega_4\underbrace{u_{s_4}(x)}_{\mathclap{\text{Community}}}
$$

* (Adapted from this <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VQw5N4qkhM&list=PLL6RiAl2WHXH1AdhB3fT5dxKIRbijvl34&index=18' target='_blank'>great intro video</a>!)

## Utilitarian SWF

* Easy mode (possibly/probably your intuition?): Everyone's welfare weight should be **equal**, $\omega_i = \frac{1}{n}$

$$
W(u_1, \ldots, u_n)(x) = \frac{1}{n}u_1(x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{n}u_n(x)
$$

* $\implies$ **Utilitarian** Social Welfare Functional!
* The Silly Problem of Utilitarian SWF: What if everyone is made happy by $u_{\text{Jeef}} = -\infty$?

## The Hard Problem of Utilitarian SWF

> While the rhetoric of "all men [sic] are born equal" is typically taken to be part and parcel of egalitarianism, the effect of ignoring the interpersonal variations can, in fact, be deeply inegalitarian, in hiding the fact that equal consideration for all may demand very unequal treatment in favour of the disadvantaged [@sen_inequality_1992]

* $\implies$ "Equality of What?"
* What is the "thing" that egalitarianism obligates us to equalize (the equilisandum/equilisanda): **Utility**? **Opportunity**? **Resources**? **Money**? **Freedom**?
