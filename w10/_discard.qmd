## Why Call It "Econometric" Policy Evaluation? {.crunch-title .title-08 .crunch-ul}

* In the same way that data science can be used for good or for not-so-good...
* Economics provides methods that allow us to **evaluate** a policy with respect to an **ethical framework**
* Typically **efficiency** and/or **profit maximization**, but just as easily **Rawlsian** or **Roemerian**
* "The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house"❓❓❓
* ("It's certainly true that the master uses the tool of [data science], but that doesn't mean he owns it.")

# Welfare Economics: Utility *Functions* $\leadsto$ Social Welfare *Functionals* {data-stack-name="The Master's Tools"}

## Lily Hu {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-quarto-layout-panel}

* CS excludes ethical considerations "by design", via focus on how computers **do** work, not how they **ought to work**.
* The latter "falls within the purview of the normative disciplines, most notably ethics, a subfield of philosophy. For students to succeed at learning not only how to build innovative computing systems, but also how to determine whether they should build those systems or how ethical considerations should constrain their design, it is imperative that these two disciplines work together. To this end, Harvard CS and Philosophy faculty have been partnering to develop the Embedded EthiCS curriculum."
