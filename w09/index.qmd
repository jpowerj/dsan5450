# Week 8 Recap {data-stack-name="Week 8 Recap"}

## 1. Privacy Policies Take a Long Time to Read! {.crunch-title .title-11 .smaller .nostretch}

![](images/terms_of_service_info.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## 2. *Reading* Privacy Policies $\neq$ *Understanding* Privacy Policies! {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* Reading vs. understanding **implications** / **contingencies** / **ambiguities**...
* NLP *could* (and *should!*) be helpful (*"making privacy policies **machine readable** [...] would help users match **privacy preferences** against **policies** offered by web services"*), but mostly just reveals how bad the problem is:

![Figure 15 from @wagner_privacy_2023. "Obfuscatory words" are words like *acceptable*, *significant*, *mainly*, or *predominantly*, interpretated at the discretion of companies rather than users (see next slide!)](images/wagner_fig.svg){fig-align="center"}

# Incomplete Contracts {data-stack-name="Incomplete Contracts"}

## The Fundamental Problem of Contracts {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .title-09}

* Just as we can't observe **two simultaneous worlds** $W_{X = 0}$ and $W_{X = 1}$ which differ only in the value of $X$,
* We can't **foresee all possible contingencies** that need to be included in a **contract**
  * (We can try, though! Hence use of obfuscatory words to **minimize liability**)
* So, when a situation arises which is not covered by a clause in the contract, what happens? What principle determines **whose interpretation wins out**?
  * (*Hint*: It is actually literally my legal middle name...)

## ...POWER!

* Examples from employment contracts (tooting own horn):
* In a private, cooperatively-owned, democratic firm, outcome determined by *conversation*, *majority vote*, *unanimity*, etc.
  * These technically exist in the US! Employing <a href='https://resources.uwcc.wisc.edu/Research/REIC_FINAL.pdf' target='_blank'>2,380 workers</a>, $\frac{2380}{127509000} \approx 0.0019\%$ of US workforce
* Otherwise, in a non-unionized private firm (94% of total), the outcome is determined by *organizational hierarchy*
  * This is the case for $\frac{125000000}{127509000} \approx 98.03\%$ of <a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USPRIV' target='_blank'>US workforce</a>

## Descriptive and Normative Implications {.crunch-title .title-09 .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote}

* Who has power w.r.t. incompleteness of contracts?
* Who **ought** to have power w.r.t. incompleteness of contracts?
* And now I can talk about the EU thing...
  * (It wasn't implemented)
  * (But idk statute of limitations)
  * (Oh well)
