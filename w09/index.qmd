## 1. Privacy Policies Take a Long Time to Read! {.crunch-title .title-11 .smaller .nostretch}

![](images/terms_of_service_info.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## 2. *Reading* Privacy Policies $\neq$ *Understanding* Privacy Policies! {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* Reading vs. understanding **implications** / **contingencies** / **ambiguities**...
* NLP *could* (and *should!*) be helpful (*"making privacy policies **machine readable** [...] would help users match **privacy preferences** against **policies** offered by web services"*), but mostly just reveals how bad the problem is:

![Figure 15 from @wagner_privacy_2023. "Obfuscatory words" are words like *acceptable*, *significant*, *mainly*, or *predominantly*, interpretated at the discretion of companies rather than users (see next slide!)](images/wagner_fig.svg){fig-align="center"}

## The Intuitive Problem of Contracts {.smaller .crunch-ul .crunch-title .crunch-quarto-figure .crunch-images}

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
::: {#intuitive-problem-left}

* Hard to read, harder to understand, possibly rly bad stuff in them, won't know until you read + understand
* Solution (in theory... in modern liberal market-based democracies): Collective action!
* Option 1 (Exit): Find better platform, use it instead $\Rightarrow$ company dies (competitive market)
* Option 2 (Voice): Raise a fuss, hoot and holler, make a big stink about it, etc.
  * $\Rightarrow$ (2a) Company will change/remove it to avoid embarrassment and/or prevent Option 1 becoming an option
  * $\Rightarrow$ (2b) Government intervention (hypothetical functional government)

## Understanding Rights $\leftrightarrow$ Fighting for Rights {.title-08 .crunch-ul}

* "Hohfeldian" framework [@hohfeld_fundamental_1913]
* A right $r_i$ granted to person $i$ $\implies$ A duty/obligation imposed on everyone in the world besides $i$ (to respect $r_i$)
* A duty or obligation $d_i$ imposed on a person $i$ $\implies$ A right granted to everyone in the world besides $i$ (to... be a potential beneficiary of $d_i$)
* $\implies$ rough measures of **relative power** in a contract:

$$
\frac{\text{rights}_i}{\text{rights}_j} = \frac{\text{obligations}_j}{\text{rights}_j} = \frac{\text{rights}_i}{\text{obligations}_j} = \frac{\text{obligations}_j}{\text{obligations}_i}
$$

## The Adversarial-Sisyphusian Problem of Contracts {.crunch-title .title-07}

* Recall Intuitive Problem of Causal Inference: Correlation $\nimplies$ Causation, **but** can do a bunch of work to overcome
* Adversarial-Sisyphusian Problem is **one level worse** üò±
  * IPCI: You vs. discovered correlation (inanimate)
  * ASPC: You vs. companies investing **resources** üí∞ into making the problem **harder and harder for you**
* tldr: The moment you ($N=1$, \$) finally find and "fix" bad thing, company ($N \gg 1$, \$\$\$) adds more ambiguity to re-enable / sends your data to \"\"\"new\"\"\", \"\"\"different\"\"\" 3rd-party processor ü•∏

## The Devastating Consequences of Corporate Scandals {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .title-07}

* <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisour_Square_massacre' target='_blank'>Nisour Square Massacre</a> (16 Sept 2007): Four Blackwater private military contractors mow down unarmed Iraqi civilians, killing 17, injuring 20
* Devastating for innocent Iraqis, but... perhaps even more devastating for Blackwater?
* (TW for next slide: Horrific consequences for murdering 17 civilians in a country 6915 miles away)

## Consequences for the Contractors {.crunch-title}

* All pardoned (#GodsPlan)

![From <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUvO0yO7N5I' target='_blank'>The Shawn Ryan Show</a>, Episode 11](images/pardoned.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

* Can make <a href='https://pipehitterfoundation.org/blackwater4/' target='_blank'>tax-deductible donation</a> to charity supporting them (I couldn't find the tax-deductible donation page for the Iraqi families, lmk if you find)

## Consequences for Blackwater {.crunch-images .crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-quarto-figure}

* They had to, like, design a whole new logo and stuff

![](images/academi.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Constellis_logo.svg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## *No Logo* / Why Johnny Can't Dissent {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote}

* Naomi Klein's *No Logo* (1999) sparked a nationwide boycott of companies employing sweatshop labor
* Great success; all companies responded and (out of the kindness of their hearts) cut ties with all of the sweatshops
* Instead, they established ties with supply chain management companies, who made the profit-maximizing decision to re-establish ties with all of the sweatshops

## Conclusion

![](images/my_life_dont_mean_shit.jpg){fig-align="center"}

# Incomplete Contracts {data-stack-name="Incomplete Contracts"}

## The Fundamental Problem of Contracts {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .title-09}

* Just as we can't observe **two simultaneous worlds** $W_{X = 0}$ and $W_{X = 1}$ which differ only in the value of $X$,
* We can't **foresee all possible contingencies** that need to be included in a **contract**
  * (We can try, though! Hence use of obfuscatory words to **minimize liability**)
* So, when a situation arises which is not covered by a clause in the contract, what happens? What principle determines **whose interpretation wins out**?
  * (*Hint*: It is actually literally my legal middle name...)

## ...POWER! {.crunch-title}

* Examples from employment contracts (tooting own horn):
* In a private, cooperatively-owned, democratic firm, outcome determined by *conversation*, *majority vote*, *unanimity*, etc.
  * These technically exist in the US! Employing <a href='https://resources.uwcc.wisc.edu/Research/REIC_FINAL.pdf' target='_blank'>2,380 workers</a>, $\frac{2380}{127509000} \approx 0.0019\%$ of US workforce
* Otherwise, in a non-unionized private firm (94% of total), the outcome is determined by *organizational hierarchy*
  * This is the case for $\frac{125000000}{127509000} \approx 98.03\%$ of <a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USPRIV' target='_blank'>US workforce</a>

## Descriptive and Normative Considerations {.crunch-title .title-09 .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote}

> The combined effect of **incomplete contracts** and **conflicts of interest** is that the determination of outcomes depends on who exercises **power** in the transaction.
> 
> Power is generally exercised by those who hold the residual rights of control, meaning **the right to determine what is not specified contractually**

* [Step 1: Measurable, empirically verifiable, etc.] **Who has power** w.r.t. a given incomplete contract?
* [Step 2: Up to you and your ethical axioms] **Who ought to have power** w.r.t. incomplete contracts?

<!-- * And now I can talk about the EU thing...
  * (It wasn't implemented)
  * (But idk statute of limitations)
  * (Oh well)

## Working Definition of Power

::: {style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 80%;"}
::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="<i class='bi bi-info-circle pe-1'></i> Defining (Dyadic) Power [@bowles_power_1992, 326-327]"}

For agent $A$ to have power over agent $B$ it is sufficient that, by imposing or threatening to impose sanctions on $B$, $A$ is capable of affecting $B$'s actions in ways that further $A$'s interests, while $B$ lacks this capacity with respect to $A$.

# Measuring Contractual Power {data-stack-name="Measuring Contractual Power"}

## (Gist of) Wealth-Power Correspondence Theorem {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .title-08 .inline-09 .smallish}

*[Axiom] Standard (Walrasian) perfectly-competitive equilibrium, no entry/exit barriers, **minus** complete-contracts assumption*

1. "Individual wealth levels $\omega_{i,t}$ determine how individuals come to hold differing structural positions": $i$'s structural position $P_{i,t}$ determined by set of feasible contracts available at $t$
2. Individual optimization of contractual arrangements between $i$ and $j$ (effort level $e_i^*$, monitoring $m_j^*$) gives rise to **authority structure** $\Rightarrow$ well-defined, **measurable degree of power** $\rho_{i \rightarrow j}(w_i, z_j)$ ($j$ has outside option $z_j$, $i$ offers wage $w_i > z_j$)
3. [Given two agents $i, j$] $\rho_{i \rightarrow j} > \rho_{j \rightarrow i}$ if and only if $\omega_i > \omega_j$ üëÄüßê

## The Crucial Input: Initial Conditions

* Steady states on previous slide are **absorbing states** of stochastic process! $w_{i,0} \rightarrow w_{i,1} \rightarrow \cdots$
* For every agent $i$, some time $T_i$ such that $\omega_{i,t}$ will be in one of those five states for $t \geq T_i$
* But how do we know **which** of the five states a given person will end up in?
  * It's a **stochastic system**, so can't say with certainty, but **can** derive results about which initial conditions maximize $\Pr(\omega_i^* = S \mid \omega_{i,0})$...
