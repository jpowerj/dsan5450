**My goal**: Obtain information about each person's valuation of headphones

**First price auction** (Game 1): Everyone says their value $\$v_i$, person $i^*$ who says highest value receives headphones for the value they said ($\$v_{i^*}$)

**Second price auction** (Game 2): Everyone says their value $\$v_i$, person $i^*$ who says highest value receives headphones for the **second-highest** value (the value said by the person right below them in the ranking)
