# What is Policy? And What is *Data* Policy? {data-stack-name="Policy Overview"}

## Discourse Around "Data Policy" in the US {.smaller .title-11 .crunch-title}

* (This is the level at which "national conversations" are conducted around big data)

## Actually-Relevant Takeaway {.smaller}

* Unlike the US, there **are** countries and national/international institutions where policies are formed, in varying degrees, by processes in which **data** comes into play
* We'll discuss more examples; two I can speak to directly from work as data consultant:
* **EU**: Consulted on project around implementation of **GDPR**
* **UNESCO**: Received grant for data-analysis of international **translation policies**
  * 194 UN member states who participate in formation of these policies
  * 2 UN member states who refuse to participate on basis of "anti-Israel bias" (you'll never guess which ones! Hint: Apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia used to provide 3rd and 4th vote in this bloc, but no longer exist)
* **NY MTA**: Consulted on project studying NYC subway data, until passage of <a href='https://ogs.ny.gov/executive-order-157' target='_blank'>NYS Executive Order 157</a> banning state funding for any person or organization supporting boycott of Israel `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## $\implies$ *Comparative* Perspective {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .crunch-li-8}

* We'll study various countries / international orgs and their attempts to tackle data policy issues (with hope that takeaways can be applied to the US someday as well)
* Important to retain **descriptive/normative distinction**!
* They'll become harder to distinguish, as we discuss:
  * What **are** the policies currently in existence?
  * What are their **drawbacks**?
  * And, among the latter, which ones **could** be addressed via policy? (requires understanding **processes of policy formation**) Which ones **could not?** (*prisoner's dilemma*)

# The Present-Day Policy Framework (Descriptive): *Notice* and *Consent* {data-stack-name="Notice and Consent"}

## OECD *Guidelines*, 1980

* "The basis for most modern privacy laws" [@sugimoto_big_2016]
* **Collection Limitation Principle**: data may be collected "where appropriate, with the knowledge or **consent** of the data subject." [@oecd_oecd_1980, 14]
* **Use Limitation Principle**: "Personal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise used for purposes other than those specified [at time of collection] except with the **consent** of the data subject" [@oecd_oecd_1980, 15]

## EU Data Protection Directive, 1995 {.title-08 .crunch-title}

* Art. 7: Processing allowed when "the data subject **has unambiguously given his [sic] consent**."
* Art. 8: Use of sensitive data is restricted, except where "the data subject **has given his [sic] explicit consent** to the processing of those data."
* Art. 26: Prohibits export of personal data to non-Euro countries lacking "adequate data protection", except when "the data subject **has given his [s] consent** unambiguously to the proposed transfer" [@europeanunion_directive_1995]
* Superceded by **GDPR** in **2018**

## EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 2018 {.smaller .crunch-title .title-09}

> «Consent is one of the easiest to satisfy because it allows you to do just about anything with the data» (---the text right below this screenshot)

## Reading / Implementing the GDPR

* Main document: 261 pages
* For SaaS companies: a nice, 34-page <a href='https://www.enterpriseready.io/gdpr/how-to-read-gdpr/' target='_blank'>abridgement</a>

## The Crux of the Normative Issues {.crunch-title .smaller .nostretch}

## Does Reading = Understanding? {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* Does reading $\implies$ understanding **implications** / **contingencies** / **ambiguities**?
* NLP *could* (and *should!*) be helpful (*"making privacy policies **machine readable** [...] would help users match **privacy preferences** against **policies** offered by web services"*), but mostly just reveals how bad the problem is:

![Figure 15 from @wagner_privacy_2023. "Obfuscatory words" are words like *acceptable*, *significant*, *mainly*, or *predominantly*, interpretated at the discretion of companies rather than users (see next slide!)](images/wagner_fig.svg){fig-align="center"}

## The Intuitive Problem of Contracts {.smaller .crunch-ul .crunch-title .crunch-quarto-figure .crunch-images}

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
::: {#intuitive-problem-left}

* Hard to read, harder to understand, possibly rly bad stuff in them, won't know until you read + understand
* Solution (in theory... in modern liberal market-based democracies): Collective action!
* Option 1 (Exit): Find better platform, use it instead $\Rightarrow$ company dies (competitive market)
* Option 2 (Voice): Raise a fuss, hoot and holler, make a big stink about it, etc.
  * $\Rightarrow$ (2a) Company will change/remove it to avoid embarrassment and/or prevent Option 1 becoming an option
  * $\Rightarrow$ (2b) Government intervention (hypothetical functional government)

## The Fundamental Problem of Contracts {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .title-08}

* Just as we can't observe **two simultaneous worlds** $W_{X = 0}$ and $W_{X = 1}$ which differ only in the value of $X$,
* We can't **foresee all possible contingencies** that need to be included in a **contract**
  * (We can try, though! Hence use of obfuscatory words to **minimize liability**)
* So, when a situation arises which is not covered by a clause in the contract, what happens? What principle determines **whose interpretation wins out**?
  * (*Hint*: It is actually literally my legal middle name...)

## ...POWER!

* Examples from employment contracts (tooting own horn):
* In a private, cooperatively-owned, democratic firm, outcome determined by *conversation*, *majority vote*, *unanimity*, etc.
  * These technically exist in the US! Employing <a href='https://resources.uwcc.wisc.edu/Research/REIC_FINAL.pdf' target='_blank'>2,380 workers</a>, $\frac{2380}{127509000} \approx 0.0019\%$ of US workforce
* Otherwise, in a non-unionized private firm (94% of total), the outcome is determined by *organizational hierarchy*
  * This is the case for $\frac{125000000}{127509000} \approx 98.03\%$ of <a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USPRIV' target='_blank'>US workforce</a>

## Descriptive and Normative Implications {.crunch-title .title-09 .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote}

* Who has power w.r.t. incompleteness of contracts?
* Who **ought** to have power w.r.t. incompleteness of contracts?
* Residual rights of control...

## Hart's Nobel Prize Speech {.crunch-title .text-90 .title-09}

> **Complete contracts** are contracts where everything that can ever happen is written into the contract. Actual contracts aren't like this, as lawyers know. They're poorly worded, ambiguous, leave out important things. They're **incomplete**.
> 
> A critical question that arises with an incomplete contract is, **who has the right to decide about the missing things?** We called this right the residual control or decision right. The question is, who has it?
> 
> Further thought led us to the idea that **this is *what ownership is***. The owner of an asset has the right to decide how the asset is used where the use is not contractually specified [@hart2017incomplete]

## Understanding Rights $\leftrightarrow$ Fighting for Rights {.title-08 .crunch-ul .math-90}

* "Hohfeldian" framework [@hohfeld_fundamental_1913]
* A right $r_i$ granted to person $i$ $\implies$ A duty/obligation imposed on everyone in the world besides $i$ (to respect $r_i$)
* A duty or obligation $d_i$ imposed on a person $i$ $\implies$ A right granted to everyone in the world besides $i$ (to... be a potential beneficiary of $d_i$)
* $\implies$ rough measures of **relative power** in a contract:

$$
\frac{\text{rights}_i}{\text{rights}_j} = \frac{\text{obligations}_j}{\text{rights}_j} = \frac{\text{rights}_i}{\text{obligations}_j} = \frac{\text{obligations}_j}{\text{obligations}_i}
$$

## The Adversarial-Sisyphusian Problem of Contracts {.crunch-title .title-07}

* Recall Intuitive Problem of Causal Inference: Correlation $\nimplies$ Causation, **but** can do a bunch of work to overcome
* Adversarial-Sisyphusian Problem is **one level worse** 😱
  * IPCI: You vs. discovered correlation (inanimate)
  * ASPC: You vs. companies investing **resources** 💰 into making the problem **harder and harder for you**
* tldr: The moment you ($N=1$, \$) finally find and "fix" bad thing, company ($N \gg 1$, \$\$\$) adds more ambiguity to re-enable / sends your data to \"new\", \"different\" 3rd-party processor 🥸
