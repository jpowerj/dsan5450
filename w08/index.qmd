# What is Policy? And What is *Data* Policy? {data-stack-name="Policy Overview"}

## Prelim: Conflict-of-Interest Disclosure {.smaller .crunch-ul .crunch-title}

* Just as I laid out my biases at the beginning of the "high-level" ethics unit...
* Now I lay out my biases at the beginning of the policy unit!
* tldr: in US context, when I encounter "policy debates", this is what they look like to me:

## Discourse Around "Data Policy" in the US Senate {.smaller .title-11 .crunch-title}

* (This is ~the level at which "national conversations" are conducted around big data)

## Prelim: Conclusion (Again, Solely My Opinion, Which I Wish I Didn't Have) {.smaller .title-07 .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote .crunch-title}

* The US is, imo, entirely hopeless on this front... short of a massive socio-political realignment on a scale that has never before occurred, sensible and just policies (data-focused or otherwise) are for all intents and purposes impossible
* US approach to social problems: fight "wars" against them, deport people, throw millions into prisons, blame CCP and their Singaporean CEO running dogs, blame Russian election-interferers, give billions of $ to Israeli election-interferers, and so on
  * (Previous examples) War on Drugs, War on Poverty, War on "Welfare Queens"
  * (Future examples, you owe me a lunch when they are announced) War on School Shootings, War on Climate Change, War on Lack of Healthcare, War on Long Lines
* But also: my opinion truly doesn't matter for purposes of learning about data policy
* **Important takeaway #1**: I would be very very happy to be proven wrong!

## Actually-Relevant Takeaway {.smaller}

* Unlike the US, there **are** countries and national/international institutions where policies are formed, in varying degrees, by processes in which **data** comes into play
* We'll discuss more examples; two I can speak to directly given work as data consultant:
* **EU**: Consulted on project around implementation of **GDPR**
* **UNESCO**: Received grant for data-analysis of international **translation policies**
  * 194 UN member states who participate in formation of these policies
  * 2 UN member states who refuse to participate on basis of "anti-Israel bias" (you'll never guess which ones! Hint: Apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia used to provide 3rd and 4th vote in this bloc, but no longer exist)
* **NY MTA**: Consulted on project studying NYC subway data, until passage of <a href='https://ogs.ny.gov/executive-order-157' target='_blank'>NYS Executive Order 157</a> banning state funding for any person or organization supporting boycott of Israel `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

## $\implies$ *Comparative* Perspective {.crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* We'll study various countries / international orgs and their attempts to tackle data policy issues (with hope that takeaways can be applied to the US someday as well)
* Important to retain **descriptive/normative distinction**!
* They'll become harder to distinguish, as we discuss:
  * What **are** the policies currently in existence?
  * What are their **drawbacks**?
  * And, among the latter, which ones **could** be addressed via policy? (requires understanding **processes of policy formation**) Which ones **could not?** (*impossibility results...*)

# The Present-Day Policy Framework (Descriptive): *Notice* and *Consent* {data-stack-name="Notice and Consent"}

## OECD *Guidelines*, 1980

* "The basis for most modern privacy laws" [@sugimoto_big_2016]
* **Collection Limitation Principle**: data may be collected "where appropriate, with the knowledge or **consent** of the data subject." [@oecd_oecd_1980, 14]
* **Use Limitation Principle**: "Personal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise used for purposes other than those specified [at time of collection] except with the **consent** of the data subject" [@oecd_oecd_1980, 15]

## EU Data Protection Directive, 1995

* Art. 7: Processing allowed when "the data subject **has unambiguously given his [sic] consent**."
* Art. 8: Use of sensitive data is restricted, except where "the data subject **has given his [sic] explicit consent** to the processing of those data."
* Art. 26: Prohibits export of personal data to non-European countries lacking "adequate data protection", except when "the data subject **has given his [sic] consent** unambiguously to the proposed transfer" [@europeanunion_directive_1995]
* Superceded by **GDPR** in **2018**

## EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 2018 {.smaller .crunch-title .title-10}

![](images/gdpr.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

> ¬´Consent is one of the easiest to satisfy because it allows you to do just about anything with the data¬ª (---the text right below this screenshot)

## Reading / Implementing the GDPR

* Main document: 261 pages
* For SaaS companies: a nice, 34-page <a href='https://www.enterpriseready.io/gdpr/how-to-read-gdpr/' target='_blank'>abridgement</a>

# (Normative) Issues with Notice and Consent {data-stack-name="Normative Issues"}

## The Crux of the Normative Issues {.crunch-title .smaller .nostretch}

## Does Reading = Understanding? {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* Does reading $\implies$ understanding **implications** / **contingencies** / **ambiguities**?
* NLP *could* (and *should!*) be helpful (*"making privacy policies **machine readable** [...] would help users match **privacy preferences** against **policies** offered by web services"*), but mostly just reveals how bad the problem is:

![Figure 15 from @wagner_privacy_2023. "Obfuscatory words" are words like *acceptable*, *significant*, *mainly*, or *predominantly*, interpretated at the discretion of companies rather than users (see next slide!)](images/wagner_fig.svg){fig-align="center"}

## The Fundamental Problem of Contracts {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .title-09}

* Just as we can't observe **two simultaneous worlds** $W_{X = 0}$ and $W_{X = 1}$ which differ only in the value of $X$,
* We can't **foresee all possible contingencies** that need to be included in a **contract**
  * (We can try, though! Hence use of obfuscatory words to **minimize liability**)
* So, when a situation arises which is not covered by a clause in the contract, what happens? What principle determines **whose interpretation wins out**?
  * (*Hint*: It is actually literally my legal middle name...)

## ...POWER!

* Examples from employment contracts (tooting own horn):
* In a private, cooperatively-owned, democratic firm, outcome determined by *conversation*, *majority vote*, *unanimity*, etc.
  * These technically exist in the US! Employing <a href='https://resources.uwcc.wisc.edu/Research/REIC_FINAL.pdf' target='_blank'>2,380 workers</a>, $\frac{2380}{127509000} \approx 0.0019\%$ of US workforce
* Otherwise, in a non-unionized private firm (94% of total), the outcome is determined by *organizational hierarchy*
  * This is the case for $\frac{125000000}{127509000} \approx 98.03\%$ of <a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USPRIV' target='_blank'>US workforce</a>

## Descriptive and Normative Implications {.crunch-title .title-09 .crunch-ul .crunch-blockquote}

* Who has power w.r.t. incompleteness of contracts?
* Who **ought** to have power w.r.t. incompleteness of contracts?
* And now I can talk about the EU thing...
  * (It wasn't implemented)
  * (But idk statute of limitations)
  * (Oh well)
